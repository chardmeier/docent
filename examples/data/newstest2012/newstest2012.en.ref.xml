        <seg id="1">Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Freeing Tymoshenko</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Today , the Ukraine parliament dismissed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , Yulia Tymoshenko , was sentenced .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">In October , Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia .</seg>
        <seg id="5">The verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear Tymoshenko 's appeal in December .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime ; in the West , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , was supported by 147 members of parliament .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Its ratification would require 226 votes .</seg>

        <seg id="2">The story of Libya 's liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">It is time to define the winners .</seg>
        <seg id="5">As a rule , Islamists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .</seg>
        <seg id="6">The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law , of which we have already heard .</seg>
        <seg id="7">Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for stealing is having one 's hand amputated .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Women can forget about emancipation ; potential religious renegades will be executed ; etc .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">Instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .</seg>
        <seg id="11">However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .</seg>
        <seg id="12">In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO raids were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .</seg>
        <seg id="15">We participated in a shooting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .</seg>
        <seg id="17">The locals thus do not have to worry about expelling of the " crusaders . "</seg>
        <seg id="18">Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya 's black gold for next to nothing , though ?</seg>
        <seg id="19">It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Unless the followers of the Sharia law put a stop to that .</seg>

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .</seg>
        <seg id="3">As a recent research shows , obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">For example , sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Moreover , the families of obese children do not practise sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">The research was performed among 900 children .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The research took place at the end of last year 's school year ; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia .</seg>
        <seg id="10">It was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event supported by both Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and Unilever .</seg>
        <seg id="11">So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">Proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13"> " For example , only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day , in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner pattern , one of the basic preconditions of correct diet , " one of the results of the research says .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="14">No lunch and sausage in the evening</seg>

        <seg id="15">Experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .</seg>
        <seg id="16">In the Czech Republic , only 23 % of schoolchildren 's families have breakfast together .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">In a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .</seg>
        <seg id="18">The worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">A survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children .</seg>
        <seg id="21">Nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 70 % ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number drops down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .</seg>

        <seg id="23">Compose your own menu</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25"> " Diet preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . "</seg>
        <seg id="26">Their favourite meals include large number of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .</seg>
        <seg id="27"> " Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , " the final report of the survey concludes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">As the main dish for lunch , pasta won very tightly over poultry .</seg>

        <seg id="1">A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist , Professionals Claim</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">In the opening article on stylist training , I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .</seg>
        <seg id="3">I had no idea what was coming .</seg>
        <seg id="4">Lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">And more is yet to come .</seg>
        <seg id="6">The closer we get to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks await .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really packed with information .</seg>
        <seg id="8">This time , together with Alenka , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">A majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical .</seg>
        <seg id="10">One has a short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .</seg>
        <seg id="11">A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the curves necessary .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">For example , if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made .</seg>
        <seg id="14">You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">In a custom-made skirt , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Given the abundance of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .</seg>
        <seg id="18">Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for : day and night .</seg>
        <seg id="20">We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victoria 's Secret campaigns .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Inside I rejoice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand I am exaggerating ) , or the very young Selena Gomez .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them .</seg>
        <seg id="24">Moodboard , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">It is important to think about the graphic part of styling .</seg>
        <seg id="26">A stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc . ) .</seg>
        <seg id="27">This is what a stylist and designer , Mario Kameník , was telling us about .</seg>
        <seg id="28">But that was not until Sunday .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">A stylist needs general knowledge</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">Saturday 's lecture , filled with information on figure types , was livened up by three guests from the field .</seg>
        <seg id="31">A stylist , Honza Pokorný ; a fashion designer , Jakub Polanka ; and a fashion photographer , Ben Renč .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .</seg>
        <seg id="33">A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .</seg>
        <seg id="34">In this case , variability is key .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="35">For example , a trench coat may be worn in the standard way , over jeans and T-shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on naked body , with step-ins , as a dress .</seg>
        <seg id="36">Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar , and the entire look changes completely .</seg>
        <seg id="37"> " Play with it , " he emphasised .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">However , I appreciated the following advice the most : " For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . "</seg>
        <seg id="39"> ' Then you can start breaking them , ' Jakub told us .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="40">Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .</seg>
        <seg id="41">Not to mention fashion shows .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="42">From Ben , the photographer , I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .</seg>
        <seg id="43">So , for a ten-page fashion story ( equals ten outfits ) , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .</seg>
        <seg id="45">We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit .</seg>
      </p>

        <seg id="46">Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success .</seg>
        <seg id="47">Just look at Madonna , who is no miraculous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="48">The attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .</seg>
        <seg id="49">Even famous people often consider it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="50">And if someone finally lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .</seg>
        <seg id="51">Then , we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining / losing weight , etc .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="52">On Sunday , both Honza and Mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit .</seg>
        <seg id="53">Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .</seg>
        <seg id="54">To be able to estimate people , not to pander , and stick to one 's opinion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="55"> " If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe telling her how awful the clothes are . "</seg>
        <seg id="56"> " Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with " Mario says .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="57">He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .</seg>
        <seg id="58">That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="59">Aside from the obvious things , such as scissors , a sticky roller , or safety pins , it should have a nylon thread ( for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats ) , special clip-ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a sewing set .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="60">To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles .</seg>
        <seg id="61">Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="62">And so we were sticking away .</seg>
        <seg id="63">You must not touch the shoes with the scissors , to avoid any damage .</seg>
        <seg id="64">This requires real skill .</seg>
        <seg id="65">Mario pleased me by praising my job .</seg>
        <seg id="66">The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="67">This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .</seg>

        <seg id="1">V Need for Speed : The Run takes place across America .</seg>
        <seg id="2">Review</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .</seg>
        <seg id="4">The ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Before it was released , the new version subtitled The Run created high expectations .</seg>
        <seg id="6">It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre .</seg>
        <seg id="7">We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Typical for the NFS series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .</seg>
        <seg id="9">The game represents a possibly decent arcade race , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .</seg>
        <seg id="10">This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The adventure opens very well .</seg>
        <seg id="12">You are introduced into a story , where the main character , Jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .</seg>
        <seg id="13">You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">The idea brings several interesting features .</seg>
        <seg id="15">The route is divided into ten stages , subdivided into over fifty races .</seg>
        <seg id="16">This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .</seg>
        <seg id="17">One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Still , it is nothing world-shattering .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or high in snow-covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">In addition , the races are , from time to time , enlivened by an untypical feature .</seg>
        <seg id="22">For example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm , significantly decreasing the visibility .</seg>
        <seg id="23">On the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an avalanche .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Individual races are ordered fairly well .</seg>
        <seg id="25">There are just a few types , but it is sufficient .</seg>
        <seg id="26">For a while , you try to overtake a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard stopwatch race ) ; or you are in a duel with a single rival .</seg>
        <seg id="27">On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">The parts outside the car are new .</seg>
        <seg id="29">They are just interactive animations , where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time .</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nothing difficult .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">It is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .</seg>
        <seg id="32">It actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be boring ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="33">The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts .</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .</seg>
        <seg id="35">If you are looking for a real-to-life simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .</seg>
        <seg id="36">Still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .</seg>
        <seg id="37">So far , everything is just right .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">However , after some time , problems come .</seg>
        <seg id="39">In contrast with the driving model , the collision model is not that good .</seg>
        <seg id="40">From a game of this type , one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="41">Typically , when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic , you sometimes lightly touch the other car . Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes .</seg>
        <seg id="42">Or , crashed completely .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="43">This is not such a big deal due to the restart system , but is enough to spoil the fun .</seg>
        <seg id="44">The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .</seg>
        <seg id="45">Nevertheless , there are only five restarts available per each race .</seg>
        <seg id="46">If you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .</seg>
        <seg id="47">This makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="48">Sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .</seg>
        <seg id="49">A significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .</seg>
        <seg id="50">For example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="51">At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .</seg>
        <seg id="52">This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .</seg>
        <seg id="53">It makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="54">The competitors have other advantages , too .</seg>
        <seg id="55">While playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot .</seg>
        <seg id="56">This is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .</seg>
        <seg id="57">Obviously , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .</seg>
        <seg id="58">The thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="59">One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin-filled , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly .</seg>
        <seg id="60">It 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .</seg>
        <seg id="61">It is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks , ordering of races , or something else .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="62">The idea of changing cars during races is unusual .</seg>
        <seg id="63">You have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="64">Cars are divided into three categories .</seg>
        <seg id="65">Sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong American cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic supersports cars for technical driving , such as along crooked mountain tracks .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="66">The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .</seg>
        <seg id="67">Here , you gain both medals and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .</seg>
        <seg id="68">Various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds .</seg>
        <seg id="69">Again , the profile is interconnected with an on-line Autolog function , which , among other things , compares the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="70">Yet another setback difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .</seg>
        <seg id="71">You and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let 's say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the darkness ( let 's say you do ) .</seg>
        <seg id="72">Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let 's say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .</seg>
        <seg id="73">For several days , our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="74">The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .</seg>
        <seg id="75">It is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather tragically , decreases .</seg>
        <seg id="76">This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="77">The sound is all right ; the soundtrack is a matter of taste .</seg>
        <seg id="78">In order to please the widest possible young audience , the soundtrack is ' flecked in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="79">Overall impression of Need for Speed : The Run is quite confused .</seg>
        <seg id="80">If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that The Run is the best part of NFS for the past several years .</seg>
        <seg id="81">However , the game feels unfinished .</seg>
        <seg id="82">It surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="6">She proved how true she is to her " Clearly and openly about Europe " motto in the very first part of her lecture , where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible , way that many lecturers from the UK Law Dept. could be jealous .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Moreover , Vicenová praised the work of new long-term President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy :</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8"> " At first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles ; I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role . "</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : " Who is the European Union ? Which phone number should I call ? " ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union 's policy towards countries such as China or India .</seg>

        <seg id="11">No One Wants To Ban Our Cheese Specialties</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">Vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past , present , and near future .</seg>
        <seg id="13">She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success .</seg>
        <seg id="14">Czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the East Partnership Summit .</seg>
        <seg id="15">She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Currently , Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy .</seg>
        <seg id="17">As the ambassadress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring .</seg>
        <seg id="18">In addition , a new seven-year EU budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Whether the budget will be slim and frugal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">The ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to Brussels : " About Europe , Clearly . "</seg>
        <seg id="21"> " I really do not like all the abbreviations , foreign words , and jargon no one understands .</seg>
        <seg id="22">How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels , people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers , different size bananas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties . '</seg>
        <seg id="23">She also wants to use the EU environment better , and get more Czechs into European institutions .</seg>

        <seg id="24">Multispeed Europe Is Coming</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">The ambassadress says Czechs are said to be Euro-sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .</seg>
        <seg id="26">She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions .</seg>
        <seg id="27">She thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the Czech side .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">Along with the success of Czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group .</seg>
        <seg id="29"> " Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary , and a Slovak is coming to join us , the Frenchman next to me says : " Hey , what 's that gathering about , is that the Visegrad Group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">In the Union 's future , Vicenová expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .</seg>
        <seg id="31">Rather than a new European Federation , she finds the concept of two-speed , if not multi-speed Europe , very realistic .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32"> " We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone . "</seg>
        <seg id="33"> " We have Schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . "</seg>
        <seg id="34"> " For the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . "</seg>
        <seg id="35"> " The number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two-speed Europe , " Vicenová expects .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">In this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influencing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the Eurozone .</seg>

        <seg id="8">Moreover , it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully .</seg>
        <seg id="9"> " For us in IMB , long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .</seg>
        <seg id="10">IMB survived and flourished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .</seg>
        <seg id="11">During our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .</seg>
        <seg id="12">In the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , " says current company Director , Samuel J. Palmisano , on the occasion of the anniversary .</seg>

        <seg id="13">Sophisticated System</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">In the 1930s , Watson approached employee care similarly to Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IMB were among the first American employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their employer , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and businessmen .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Just as sophisticated is IBM 's long-term relationship with customers .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">From the very beginning , the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people . It was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , Virginia Rometty , to take over after Palmisano next year .</seg>
        <seg id="18">She has been working in IMB for thirty years ; she is currently a Director of Sales , Marketing , and Strategy .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">In the last few years , IMB has been organising jams , on-line brainstorming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .</seg>
        <seg id="20">It is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Institution with a Good Reputation</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Company 's strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .</seg>
        <seg id="23"> " From the beginning , the concept of IBM was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a Harvard Business School Professor and author of a book about IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter , told the Economist .</seg>
        <seg id="24"> " IBM is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , " George Colony of Forrester Research consultation company adds .</seg>
        <seg id="25">As the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">During the hundred years , IMB , or the " Big Blue , " as it is called in the US because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .</seg>
        <seg id="27">It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .</seg>
        <seg id="28">It holds the most patents of all American technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price .</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its inventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .</seg>
        <seg id="30">With about 220 billion dollars , based on market capitalisation , IBM has become the second largest technology company ( Apple being number one ) this year , overrunning Microsoft for the first time since 1996 .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32">Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . For example , IBM failed with its own operating system OS / 2 ; Prodigy on-line services ; and IBM PCjr computers .</seg>
        <seg id="33"> " If your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says Samuel J. Palmisano .</seg>
        <seg id="34">That is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .</seg>
        <seg id="35">This is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , Microsoft , which basically stands and falls on Windows , its operating system .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">Perspective Technology</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="37">IBM 's revenues chiefly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .</seg>
        <seg id="38">While in 1990 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="39">Since 2000 , IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . During the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .</seg>
        <seg id="40">It has continued the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .</seg>
        <seg id="41">IBM follows the legacy of its first director , Thomas J. Watson , who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression .</seg>
        <seg id="42">So far , IMB seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .</seg>
        <seg id="43">Since the beginning of 2008 , the price of IBM 's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company 's net earnings have been growing continuously .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">IBM 's company motto is to change everything , except for its values .</seg>
        <seg id="45">We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .</seg>

        <seg id="46">IBM History : From Cheese Cutter To Space Travel</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="47">IBM ( International Business Machines ) was founded in New York , a hundred years ago . Its original name " Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation " was quite complicated .</seg>
        <seg id="48">It took the name of IBM in 1924 . Originally , this was a brand used for company 's branches in Canada and South America .</seg>
        <seg id="49">Foundations for the later IBM were laid by a merger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 1880s .</seg>
        <seg id="50">They owned technologies such as the legendary " time clock , " i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="51">The architect of the new company was a businessman , Charles Ranlett Flint , who , until 1930 , also presided over the company 's Board of Trustees .</seg>
        <seg id="52">Flint hired a director of a competing company , Thomas J. Watson , to help him with company management .</seg>
        <seg id="53">The leader then put the IBM 's founder in the shade - Watson 's ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity .</seg>
        <seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952 .</seg>
        <seg id="55">IBM , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers .</seg>
        <seg id="56">During the first four years of Watson 's leadership , the revenue doubled to nine million dollars , and company 's vast expansion into all continents commenced .</seg>
        <seg id="57">Watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's chair was taken by his son , Thomas Watson Junior .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="58">Under his leadership , IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .</seg>
        <seg id="59">In 1960s , both people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury , Saturn , and in 1969 , man 's flight to the Moon .</seg>
        <seg id="60">Meanwhile , in 1964 , IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System / 360 .</seg>
        <seg id="61">The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the period , called IBM 5150 , came to the market in 1981 .</seg>
        <seg id="62">Twenty years later , IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company , Lenovo , While buying the consultant division of PricewaterhouseCoopers , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .</seg>
        <seg id="63">In the past three years , IBM has been highly successful with its Smarter Planet concept .</seg>
        <seg id="64">Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="65">For commerce , IBM has recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .</seg>
        <seg id="66">IBM 's history is strong even in our country .</seg>
        <seg id="67">In former Czechoslovakia , as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe , IBM founded its branch in 1932 .</seg>
        <seg id="68">Today , IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno .</seg>
        <seg id="69">The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe resides in Prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">As travelling to the West was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">For their holiday , Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic ; Soviet Union ( Sochi , Crimea near the Black Sea ) ; Bulgaria ; Romania ( both to the Black Sea ) ; and Hungary ( Balaton ) .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="5">The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 , when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia . Nevertheless , the Yugoslavian regime turned West , which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="6">A great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. Czechoslovaks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .</seg>
        <seg id="7">If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel , as an individual , to , for example , the Soviet Union or Poland , an invitation letter from the country was necessary ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">At the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the West , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some " good friends " in the agency .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Still , that was not all .</seg>
        <seg id="10">A foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the West . It was not granted to politically unreliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible ; without the currency assurance , it was not possible to obtain financial means ( Western currency ) for travelling West .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">Most often , Czechs spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses , a habit that survives until now .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Since 1989 , Czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">While until 1989 , a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the climax of our travels , last year , Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">A great paradox we do not realise anymore is that until 1989 , we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia , as it was part of former Yugoslavia .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled . This started a huge wave of short-term visits of chiefly Vienna and Germany .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West . Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment .</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example , in Paris , Czech tours slept in parks in tents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">A typical feature of Czech tourism then was bringing their own food ( cans , salami , etc . ) to save money .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown . After decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Our living standards and average income were growing , which , around 1997 , resulted in another important moment .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . Compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">By the end of 1990s , Czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries , except for the USA . This made our travelling even easier .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">The next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000 . High demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country , Thailand .</seg>
        <seg id="25">Since then , direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries . This winter , flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations .</seg>
        <seg id="26">Currently about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year !</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Yet another important event of this period , symbolising our development after the revolution , came in 2008 .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28"> On November 17 , 2008 , the USA removed visa requirements for Czech tourists . Our country has thus permanently joined the world 's most developed countries .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">For the first time in history , in 2008 Czechs spent more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 50.3 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 15 thousand Crowns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .</seg>

        <seg id="1">General Meeting Should Find a President , Mate Threat Returns</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">For nearly five months , Czech football has had no President . There exists a risk that Ivan Hašek 's successor , the head of Czech Republic 's Football Association ( FAČR ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday .</seg>
        <seg id="3">There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow .</seg>
        <seg id="4">Without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta , and Tomáš Paclík are eager to lead Czech football .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">Hašek resigned from his function in June . When leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .</seg>
        <seg id="7">However , Hašek 's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers , unable to agree on a common candidate .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">This was fully shown on September 16 , when a new President was to be chosen .</seg>
        <seg id="9">General meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House in Prague , Smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .</seg>
        <seg id="10">No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of attorney .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">This single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Arguments concerning the election rules continue , though .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">The Executive Board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly preoccupied by this issue .</seg>
        <seg id="14">The view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .</seg>
        <seg id="15">The question is : How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16"> " The argument is based on whether to follow the by-laws or to find another model , " says one of the three FAČR Vice-Presidents , Dušan Svoboda , who represents professional football in the association 's management .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Based on the model given by the by-laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .</seg>
        <seg id="18">Moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two-third superiority .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20"> " However , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two-chamber concept , " Svoboda agrees with Moravia 's arguments . He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Somewhat surprisingly Tomáš Paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by-laws fits Pelta best of the candidates .</seg>
        <seg id="22"> ' I wish the elections follow the by-laws to the maximum . '</seg>
        <seg id="23"> " I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the previous general meeting , " says the owner of Viktorie Plzeň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against Pelta .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Pelta remains an optimist .</seg>
        <seg id="25">He believes the new President will be known in Nymburk ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .</seg>
        <seg id="26"> " All passionate stirring will calm down with today 's prospective advance of the national team into the European Championship . "</seg>
        <seg id="27"> " Football will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a Jablonec functionary says . Of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">Rajchl is more reserved .</seg>
        <seg id="29"> " I hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambivalent . "</seg>
        <seg id="30"> " It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia , but there are attempts at purposeful adjustment of regulations . "</seg>
        <seg id="31"> " That may cause another blockage of the general meeting . "</seg>
        <seg id="32"> " I hope the common sense wins , " Rajchl said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="33">There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .</seg>
        <seg id="34">Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro ; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match .</seg>
        <seg id="35">An extra flight that was to take , among others , the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure . An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">Finally , a meeting at ministry level , said to happen on Wednesday , may decide .</seg>
        <seg id="37">Minister of Education , Youth , and Sports , Josef Dobeš , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .</seg>
        <seg id="38">A lot is in the game : Government grants ; football trustworthiness ; and the planned ČSTV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazka 's financial problems .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="39">Paclík Enters the Presidential Fight As He Cannot See a Suitable Candidate</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="40">If , before the extraordinary general meeting , the Head of Pilsen football players , Tomáš Paclík , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic ( FAČR ) President , he would not even apply for the top function .</seg>
        <seg id="41"> " If there was a good quality candidate , I 'd fight for him and not participate in the fight . "</seg>
        <seg id="42"> " But no such person has currently been found , " Paclík said to ČTK .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="43">Paclík 's motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the FAČR .</seg>
        <seg id="44">Moreover , Paclík emphasizes that should he win , he would only remain the President until 2013 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="45">In the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not excessively connected to football life .</seg>
        <seg id="46"> " I 've spoken to some people that could be considered . "</seg>
        <seg id="47"> " I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they don 't even want to identify themselves with Czech football . "</seg>
        <seg id="48"> " I 'd like to change this opinion , " he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="49">At the moment , Paclík 's strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latter 's connection to Roman Berbr , President of Pilsen 's regional football association . Berber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .</seg>
        <seg id="50">Paclík therefore finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become the President .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="51"> " If he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "</seg>
        <seg id="52"> " Combined with support from Berbr , a capable businessman , this would be even more harmful for the football , " Paclík said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="53">He is hinting at the fact that some years ago , Pelta 's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation ; Pelta came out without a sentence .</seg>
        <seg id="54"> " I don 't know what prestige Pelta 's victory would bring to football . "</seg>
        <seg id="55"> " And how would we look in the eyes UEFA and FIFA , " Paclík said . He is now more detached from his former statement saying he would " sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became President . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="56">In case Paclík wins on Thursday , he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future .</seg>
        <seg id="57">This opinion is shared by another candidate , Rajchl , whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="58"> " He ( Pelta ) would be the first one I 'd go to . "</seg>
        <seg id="59"> ' He is very capable . '</seg>
        <seg id="60"> " I can see him as the head of the representation . "</seg>
        <seg id="61"> ' But he cannot manage the association . '</seg>
        <seg id="62"> " I don 't poke my nose in what I don 't understand either , ' said Paclík , who gained a lot of attention in September , when he supported the removal of board of referees , led by Luděk Macela , replaced by Dagmar Damková .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="63">Paclík claims he would dare to manage the association .</seg>
        <seg id="64">He refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the Pilsen team that , with his support , celebrated its first league triumph in May .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="65"> " I have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . "</seg>
        <seg id="66"> " To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board , leading to disgusting situations , " Paclík said . He does not hide his antipathy for , e.g. Sparta 's Director , Daniel Křetínský .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="67">One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .</seg>
        <seg id="68"> " That 's one of the key things the new President should attend to . "</seg>
        <seg id="69"> " If taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , I understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="70">Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden , though he claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one .</seg>
        <seg id="71">Pelta is connected to Jablonec , and Rajchl to Prague Dukla .</seg>
        <seg id="72"> " It 's not ideal . "</seg>
        <seg id="73"> " Yet , I don 't see a point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " Paclík says .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="74">Pelta Promised New FAČR Regulations That Would Avoid Election Mate</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the Presidential candidates , Miroslav Pelta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new FAČR regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .</seg>
        <seg id="76">Before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk , a Jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the pre-election fight would be significantly suppressed by today 's prospective success of our football representation .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="77">Prior to the failed election in September , Pelta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .</seg>
        <seg id="78">He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . A two-month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="79"> " People at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the President to be known on Thursday . "</seg>
        <seg id="80"> " They feel it 's high time someone leads the association , " claims the man chiefly connected with the Jablonec club ; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association 's executive board .</seg>
        <seg id="81">This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="82">He believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of Ivan Hašek 's reign .</seg>
        <seg id="83"> " Unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June . "</seg>
        <seg id="84"> " If various representations were not accepted , we would have had a President since September , " Pelta said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="85">He approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates .</seg>
        <seg id="86"> " If I become President , I will take it as my personal task , and I 'm willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . "</seg>
        <seg id="87"> " It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , " Pelta claims .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="88">Other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals .</seg>
        <seg id="89">In the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="90">For a long time , he did not attack Tomáš Paclík , who has constantly criticised Pelta .</seg>
        <seg id="91"> " He 's been in football for over a year , and gained some success . "</seg>
        <seg id="92"> " However , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . "</seg>
        <seg id="93"> " This is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , " Pelta said about his rival . Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in September .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="94">He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .</seg>
        <seg id="95">The representation should be the shopping window of football .</seg>
        <seg id="96"> " Í would also try to end all affairs , starting from the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year 's corruption scandal . "</seg>
        <seg id="97"> " Right after that , I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , " the forty-six year old candidate told ČTK two months ago .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="98">He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning .</seg>
        <seg id="99"> " I 'd need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . " That was his message for Strahov , where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="100">Despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on Thursday , the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain .</seg>
        <seg id="101"> " If the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "</seg>
        <seg id="102"> " Football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader , " says Pelta , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary , remains an optimist .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="103">Rajchl Promises That under Him , the FAČR Will Start Working Hard</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="104">If , on Thursday 's general meeting , Jindřich Rajchl , the existing Vice President , is to become the President of Czech Football Association , many people in the Association would reportedly not be pleased .</seg>
        <seg id="105">Rajchl promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .</seg>
        <seg id="106">He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .</seg>
        <seg id="107">He also promised to solve the Bohemians case ; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous President , Ivan Hašek .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="108"> " As President , I 'd like to focus on football as a whole . "</seg>
        <seg id="109"> " From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . "</seg>
        <seg id="110"> " By this , I don 't mean I 'd do everything on my own , " Rajchl said in his interview for ČTK .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="111"> " I 'm a team player , and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . "</seg>
        <seg id="112"> ' I 'll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . "</seg>
        <seg id="113"> " That would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just criticizing of the work of others , " he added .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="114">Critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature .</seg>
        <seg id="115"> " I 'm known to work 20 hours a day . "</seg>
        <seg id="116"> " But I need to know if it has any sense ; and that I won 't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move , " he explained his hesitation .</seg>
        <seg id="117"> " However , many people told me I mustn 't give up , otherwise others would follow . "</seg>
        <seg id="118"> " That 's a trust I can 't just throw away , " he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="119">Moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hašek .</seg>
        <seg id="120"> " A great amount of work was done in those two years , and I don 't want to throw it all away . "</seg>
        <seg id="121"> " Processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and I don 't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , Miroslav Pelta , is elected , situation f the Association might return to the period before Hašek .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="122"> " I believe in systematic approach , which is something I don 't think Mirek Pelta is competent of . "</seg>
        <seg id="123"> " He is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . "</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="134">While claiming that Pelta has been ' disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football ' , he considers the other rival , Paclík , a strong candidate that has things to offer .</seg>
        <seg id="135"> " No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year . "</seg>
        <seg id="136"> " If he is elected , I hope he would continue in the things Ivan Hašek started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . "</seg>
        <seg id="137"> " He wouldn 't want to twist things for his own benefit , " Rajchl said about his rival .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest . Travellers can experience Europe 's incredible water - and relax tired limbs in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a ramble .</seg>
        <seg id="5">One book can tell you where the water is at its best .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">There was one thing Iris Meder could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her swimming costume .</seg>
        <seg id="7">Lying back on the water , she has looked up at artistically designed domes , has swum towards marble cherubs awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has marvelled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools .</seg>
        <seg id="8">She rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The architectural historian Meder looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book Badefreuden ( The Joys of Bathing ) , covering everything from public swimming baths in Munich to historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest and " hardcore concrete buildings " in Taunus .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Her " journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe " took here through 13 countries . Besides Germany , Austria and Switzerland , she visited baths in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The 46-year-old is a real bathing culture enthusiast .</seg>
        <seg id="12">She has very little enthusiasm for sport , says Meder - but in the water , it 's a different matter .</seg>
        <seg id="13">The only downside is that fans of swimming have to cope with blue glazed tiles and the stench of chlorine while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to the bright twittering of birds in the park .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14"> " One day , I asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ugly , " says Vienna-based Meder .</seg>
        <seg id="15"> " So I started collecting beautiful baths . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Water surface doubles architecture</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Splashing in the diving pool and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated , according to Meder .</seg>
        <seg id="18">And swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the builders have gone to the trouble . " You have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . "</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " The surface is very transparent , but also reflects the beauty of the entire building . "</seg>
        <seg id="20">Everything is mirrored visually : high ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">The illustrated pocketbook The Joys of Bathing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health oases over 190 pages - and makes you want to leap into the water .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Pool collector Meder discovered some notable examples during research in Hungary .</seg>
        <seg id="23">She found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave ( the Cave Bath in Miskolctapolca ) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building ( Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi baths in Budapest .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Many of the heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . You can view all of Zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St. Anton . And there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski piste .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld . The Aqua Dome in Ötztal looks like a UFO has just landed in the Alps .</seg>
        <seg id="26">It steams during the winter from three open-topped shells dwarfed by the Ötztal mountains behind it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">Pool collector Meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool .</seg>
        <seg id="29">A lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur . The Árpád baths in Békescsaba , Hungary , smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .</seg>
        <seg id="30">The smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water . The water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">Iris Meder , however , was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places . When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz , she found the area sealed off .</seg>
        <seg id="32">The baths , designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 , have been closed .</seg>
        <seg id="33">When Meder looked through the weather-beaten windows of the red , white and yellow art nouveau building , she could see weeds growing up through the tiles .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="34">One place where decay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the Black Forest - the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad .</seg>
        <seg id="35">The baths have already gone through three stages of construction . You will not only discover neo-Romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844 , but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style added around 1900 .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">Following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the Palais Thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she comes from the Black Forest .</seg>
        <seg id="37"> " It is a real achievement to harmonise such different architectural styles so brilliantly , " says Meder .</seg>
        <seg id="38">A dip in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural commodities ?</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to SPIEGEL ONLINE , Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .</seg>
        <seg id="6">The CEO plans to make changes in January .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
        <seg id="8">For German citizens the situation is clear . According to one study , 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Two thirds of those questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The findings were made in a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October .</seg>
        <seg id="12">The author of the report , Harald Schumann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .</seg>
        <seg id="13">The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank , Josef Ackermann , although large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Originally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations .</seg>
        <seg id="15">However , most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">In contrast to US competitors , Ackermann has responded to the criticism . He has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is " worth putting Deutsche Bank 's good reputation at risk . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">According to SPIEGEL ONLINE , an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report .</seg>
        <seg id="18">The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank 's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Commodities trading may be reduced or stopped completely .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Ackermann working on his image</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">The president of Foodwatch , Thilo Bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " Betting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">As top bank lobbyist , Ackermann has a particular duty , according to Bode .</seg>
        <seg id="24"> " Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , " said Bode .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " It does not matter whether this is about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">Ackermann 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .</seg>
        <seg id="27">Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .</seg>
        <seg id="28">Cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image .</seg>
        <seg id="29">He also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">One in two people would withdraw commodities investments</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">Foodwatch is striving to keep up the pressure on the manager .</seg>
        <seg id="32">To date , more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .</seg>
        <seg id="33">Bode published the survey on Tuesday . The survey was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November and 1001 people took part .</seg>
        <seg id="34">No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="35">Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . According to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .</seg>
        <seg id="36">43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">An architectural history with highs , lows and a happy-ever-after . Austria 's Pavilion for the 1958 World 's Fair in Brussels won prizes , became a museum in Vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">Austria 's pavilion , designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World 's Fair , is a famous textbook example of modern post-war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .</seg>
        <seg id="7">Schwanzer 's pavilion won the Grand Prix d 'Architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel-glass structure .</seg>
        <seg id="8">The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture .</seg>
        <seg id="9">It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria 's pavilion at the next world 's fair .</seg>
        <seg id="10">He finally shot to fame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW Tower and its bowl-shaped sister building .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The pavilion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was relocated to the Schweizer Garten near Vienna 's Südbahnhof , converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the " 20er Haus " for this reason .</seg>
        <seg id="12">However , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home .</seg>
        <seg id="14">The building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now renovated the pavilion , which has been named the " 21er Haus " and will be used as a contemporary art museum .</seg>
        <seg id="16">The museum is a branch of the Belvedere museum , which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Agnes Husslein-Arco who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new beginning .</seg>
        <seg id="18">Husslein-Arco , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice skater , who went on to Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg , convinced politicians and conservators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The new museum was to house the Fritz Wotruba Foundation 's permanent collection , a café and a bookshop alongside contemporary art . An office building was also to be built .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Strict supervision &amp; limited budget</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Krischanitz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .</seg>
        <seg id="22">He was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded Joseph Olbrich 's Secession in Vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited exhibitions " almost every weekend . "</seg>
        <seg id="23">He knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and converted .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">The problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . The building was " an energy guzzler , " says Krischanitz .</seg>
        <seg id="25">The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , fibreglass-reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high-grade safety glass .</seg>
        <seg id="26">Thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings .</seg>
        <seg id="27">Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate Schwanzer pavilion .</seg>
        <seg id="28">The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red-brown colour of rust-proofing .</seg>
        <seg id="29">And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .</seg>
        <seg id="30">All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .</seg>
        <seg id="31"> " We often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , " says Krischanitz , pointing to the rough flooring in the basement .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32">The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and conversions .</seg>
        <seg id="33">Krischanitz stated recently that the pavilion " from Brussels " had been tough - a typical " drop in the city " story .</seg>
        <seg id="34">Architecture like this is " always in the wrong place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="35">The 21er Haus is very much in the right place , as there has been a stroke of luck in town planning . The completely redesigned " main station quarter " with offices and residential properties is developing around the Schweizer Garten .</seg>
        <seg id="36">There may also be a second stroke of luck . The 21er Haus may be bolstered by another Krischanitz building - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten .</seg>

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company , IBM .</seg>
        <seg id="3">Since March , he has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Until now , the major American investor , Warren Buffett , had always claimed not to invest in IT and computing companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long-term development .</seg>
        <seg id="5">However , IBM 's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">According to Buffett , he should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies .</seg>
        <seg id="7">Investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world .</seg>
        <seg id="8">The IT veteran IBM has now earned the title of " Sir IBM . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">Buffett revealed that he had purchased IBM shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars since March on the US business news broadcaster CNBC .</seg>
        <seg id="10">His investment holding company , Berkshire Hathaway , has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently .</seg>
        <seg id="12">He praised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis .</seg>
        <seg id="13"> " They have done a great job , " said Buffett , referring to the management strategy .</seg>
        <seg id="14">For a fairly long time , IBM has focused on lucrative IT services such as data centres .</seg>
        <seg id="15">The computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services , as well as powerful business computers .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Buffett had avoided technology firms to date .</seg>
        <seg id="17">He claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands</seg>
        <seg id="18">and invested in a freight railway , for example , a lubricant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer .</seg>
        <seg id="19">His holding company , Berkshire Hathaway , owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re ( formerly Münchener Rück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it up , with clever investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .</seg>
        <seg id="21">His lifestyle , however , has remained humble ,</seg>
        <seg id="22">making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world .</seg>
        <seg id="23">His almost infallible instinct for making money has earned him a nickname as the " Oracle from Omaha . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of Buffett 's investment .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " Big Blue , " as IBM is also known , is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft .</seg>
        <seg id="26">Buffett , however , has said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft .</seg>
        <seg id="27">The founder , Bill Gates , is a close friend .</seg>

        <seg id="2">Following the discovery of the " Zwickau cell , " Turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in Germany .</seg>
        <seg id="3">One newspaper speaks of a " bloody ideology " that is now resurfacing .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right-wing extremist ideology .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Fear and concern has been the reaction to this report in Turkey and within the German-Turkish community in Germany .</seg>
        <seg id="6">For many German Turks , the news brings back to life a long-dead spectre . There has been no comparable right-wing extremist violence against Turks since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 .</seg>
        <seg id="7">There was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in Germany .</seg>
        <seg id="8">The right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9"> " Is this a revival of the bloody ideology ? " was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The Sabah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be caught up in the right-wing extremist quagmire .</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Turkish Community of Germany ( TGD ) reacted calmly , remembering the victims of racial violence during a silent vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Just two weeks earlier , the Turkish Community in Berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">The coverage by some Turkish media has been like a slap in the face . " Germany 's present on the fiftieth anniversary " is the title of one article on the Haber X Turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders .</seg>
        <seg id="15">The German edition of Hürriyet also does not miss the chance to make this connection .</seg>
        <seg id="16"> " It is beginning to stink , " is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci .</seg>
        <seg id="17">He points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany 's redevelopment with their work .</seg>
        <seg id="18">The behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful manhunt is heavily criticised on German-Turkish internet forums .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . " If things continue to be done so cack-handedly , migrants have no option but armed self-defence . "</seg>
        <seg id="21"> " That will be the best self-defence . "</seg>
        <seg id="22"> " Peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment , " writes " Selen . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">The attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 90s are an example of what it means for peace in Germany to be at risk .</seg>
        <seg id="24">The photo of the burnt out ruin of Solingen is deeply engrained in German and Turkish memory .</seg>
        <seg id="25">No other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is imminent danger and shown the Germans that mistrust and distance can culminate in real violence .</seg>
        <seg id="26">The attacks , however , increased the sense of Turkish unity .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Do not repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">The Turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of German policy following the attacks . Helmut Kohl declined to visit the survivors in Mölln .</seg>
        <seg id="29">He sent a telegram of commiseration to the Turkish president after the arson attack in Solingen , but it was his foreign minister , Klaus Kinkel , who took his place at the memorial ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel summed up in his speech the taxes Turks contribute in Germany ,</seg>
        <seg id="30">just as if he were calculating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the current German state has become since .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Straight talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany .</seg>

        <seg id="3">UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since .</seg>
        <seg id="4">A German is now to bring it back in line .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Axel Weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role .</seg>
        <seg id="6">After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal bank , it was announced in July that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Axel Weber was clearly delighted , praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .</seg>
        <seg id="8"> " UBS has managed to turn around . "</seg>
        <seg id="9"> " I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">But by September it was already clear that everything would be very different .</seg>
        <seg id="11">A UBS trader in London had bypassed all the bank 's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion Euros .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">UBS CEO , Oswald Grübel - a banker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go .</seg>
        <seg id="13">The UBS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will Axel Weber finally arrive ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Weber is to advise the bank from February 2012 .</seg>
        <seg id="15">And he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May , and not in 2013 , the bank announced on Tuesday .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">That will be tough for Axel Weber .</seg>
        <seg id="17">He is an economics professor and central banker , not a conventional banker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .</seg>
        <seg id="18">All at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of " Europe 's biggest banking scandal . "</seg>
        <seg id="19">UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years .</seg>
        <seg id="20">The proud Swiss bank , it seems , is to be spared nothing .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">It began in the financial crisis .</seg>
        <seg id="22">UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007 .</seg>
        <seg id="23">The bank combined the image of the secretive and solid , but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .</seg>
        <seg id="24">As a result , in 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world ,</seg>
        <seg id="25">and had risen to the league of the world 's biggest banks as an investment bank .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">That made an impression .</seg>
        <seg id="27">The former banker and long-standing banking professor at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich , Hans Geiger , explains : " I always presented UBS to my students as the model of a good bank . "</seg>
        <seg id="28"> " From what we know today , you have to ask how I could be so wrong . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">He was very wrong indeed .</seg>
        <seg id="30">It only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at UBS .</seg>
        <seg id="31">In the middle of the year , CEO Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Some months later we could guess at why he had left .</seg>
        <seg id="33">The investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions .</seg>
        <seg id="34">UBS announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis .</seg>
        <seg id="35">The bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive , even its name was not disclosed .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">That was just the first blow .</seg>
        <seg id="37">It got a lot worse in April 2008 .</seg>
        <seg id="38">The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors , Marcel Ospel - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned .</seg>
        <seg id="39">Catastrophe followed in October 2008 . UBS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .</seg>
        <seg id="40">The National Bank bought up toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="41">The whole of Switzerland was shocked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .</seg>
        <seg id="42">After all , the balance sheet total for UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland ( see chart ) .</seg>
        <seg id="43"> " We would not be able to save the UBS for a second time , " says banking researcher Geiger .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">The second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first .</seg>
        <seg id="45">A few months later , UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .</seg>
        <seg id="46">UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="47">UBS therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion .</seg>
        <seg id="48">At the same time , UBS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy .</seg>
        <seg id="49">Swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal .</seg>
        <seg id="50">The CEO and the Chairman then resigned and</seg>
        <seg id="51">the exodus of client money began .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="52">The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="53">And just as things had calmed down and UBS looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous rogue trader . A single trader gambled away 1.7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .</seg>
        <seg id="54">One thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="55"> " The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , " says Martin Janssen , economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich .</seg>
        <seg id="56">The CFO of one major German bank also has no doubts : " The problem facing UBS is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="57">It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss bankers the guardians of the world 's major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine republic or not .</seg>
        <seg id="58">The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability , just as Lindt and Sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="59">The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .</seg>
        <seg id="60">The location alone is classic .</seg>
        <seg id="61">The bank has its head office on Zurich 's Bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake , surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains .</seg>
        <seg id="62">The buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe .</seg>
        <seg id="63">Jewellers such as Tiffany 's are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli .</seg>
        <seg id="64">The Swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Bär .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="65">A heavy revolving door opens onto the UBS reception .</seg>
        <seg id="66">The walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs . There is a large sign to the " Safe " next to the bank 's logo .</seg>
        <seg id="67">UBS knows that its clients are looking for - security .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="68">But both the major Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , at some point ousted the Swiss banking concept - or betrayed it , as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes .</seg>
        <seg id="69">He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all Swiss bankers , does business with the two major banks .</seg>
        <seg id="70">He believes UBS has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the Anglo-Saxons are also very active .</seg>
        <seg id="71">In his opinion , the Swiss have nothing to add .</seg>
        <seg id="72"> " And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons long ago . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="73">It was in fact Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS , brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle . No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="74">The catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008 .</seg>
        <seg id="75"> " That Wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , " writes author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash .</seg>
        <seg id="76">The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs ( around 45 billion Euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="77">How could it have come to that ?</seg>
        <seg id="78">Talking to Swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of UBS .</seg>
        <seg id="79">Two of the three major Swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in June 1998 .</seg>
        <seg id="80">A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="81">The fact that the two banks that went to form UBS complemented each other helped . One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy , but much more internationalised .</seg>
        <seg id="82">The internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="83">Two names are connected with the rise of UBS : Peter Wuffli , Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , Chairman of the Board of Directors .</seg>
        <seg id="84"> " I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team , " says the banking research , Hans Geiger .</seg>
        <seg id="85"> " Wuffli , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and Ospel , with gut instinct who had worked his way up from being a banker 's apprentice . "</seg>
        <seg id="86">But Ospel in the end relied on Wuffli .</seg>
        <seg id="87">And Wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error . " He thought his models were reality , " says Geiger .</seg>
        <seg id="88"> " That is tragic . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="89">Tragic it may be .</seg>
        <seg id="90">Pride comes before a fall .</seg>
        <seg id="91">Employees of UBS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wuffli always repeated the same slogan - dethrone Goldman Sachs .</seg>
        <seg id="92">The American bank was the world 's most powerful investment bank .</seg>
        <seg id="93">It led the " league tables " that documented the success of the banks at that time .</seg>
        <seg id="94">UBS wanted to get to the very top of the league .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>

        <seg id="96">UBS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .</seg>
        <seg id="97">Commissioned management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . In terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as " fixed income , " UBS was far behind the very largest banks .</seg>
        <seg id="98">UBS had gaps in its US mortgage products .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="99">To plug the hole , UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .</seg>
        <seg id="100">Hungry for growth , the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities .</seg>
        <seg id="101">It developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on US mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .</seg>
        <seg id="102">Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , UBS carried on .</seg>
        <seg id="103"> " UBS was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the US housing market was in flames , " says banking expert Geiger .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="104">The greater the rise , the greater the fall .</seg>
        <seg id="105">One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .</seg>
        <seg id="106">Posts at UBS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="107">Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .</seg>
        <seg id="108">He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="109">Banking expert Geiger already has an idea - quit investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to Swiss roots .</seg>
        <seg id="110">The bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .</seg>
        <seg id="111">It is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must shrink significantly .</seg>
        <seg id="112">The new head of the bank , Sergio Ermotti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday .</seg>
        <seg id="113">The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor Grübel .</seg>
        <seg id="114">Since then , he has proved his mettle and is now to head UBS permanently , the Zurich-based bank announced on Tuesday .</seg>
        <seg id="115">Ermotti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-90s .</seg>
        <seg id="116">He is cutting 3500 jobs .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="117">But that will not be enough .</seg>
        <seg id="118">UBS needs a vision .</seg>
        <seg id="119">What is UBS ?</seg>
        <seg id="120">How does it plan to make money ?</seg>
        <seg id="121">Those are the questions Axel Weber is definitely already asking himself .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="2">Rooks are considered problem birds in many places . Experts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">Some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . Crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years , but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">A solution to the problem birds , however , is far from within reach .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Looking for alternatives in the cities</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Conservationists stated that migration of specially protected rooks was the root of the problem in cities , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Hunting , increasing development and felling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Crows are protected .</seg>
        <seg id="11">There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian town of Soest and in the north-west in Jever , Diepholz , Achim bei Bremen and Leer .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">A controversial project to cull crows in Leer was behind negative headlines in 2005 .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as particularly brutal .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14"> " Normal displacement and deterrence does nothing , " said town and country planner Werner Klöver from Leer .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Spraying off nests with water or felling trees often has undesired consequences , said environment expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg .</seg>
        <seg id="16"> " The animals disperse and large colonies split up and spread to other areas . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Deterrence would only be conceivable as an exception in hospitals , retirement homes and schools .</seg>
        <seg id="18"> " We have to live with them . Getting rid of them is not an option . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be solved , said Leer 's mayor , Wolfgang Kellner .</seg>
        <seg id="20">A combination of deterring birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21"> " Information boards instead of chain saws " was the slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens , who argued for a totally different approach to the birds . " We should have the self-confidence to live with this problem . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Jürgens was a co-founder of the Ascherberg crow educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein , where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rook .</seg>
        <seg id="23">The project is already attracting interest from tourists .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . " The noise conveys a lot of information . They have a lot to say to each other . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . Rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel , but create tools themselves .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the extent of the birds " intelligence on four rooks .</seg>
        <seg id="27">In one experiment , the birds quickly learnt that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva .</seg>
        <seg id="28">They recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">In a second experiment , the canny crows had to solve a trickier problem .</seg>
        <seg id="30">The researchers put a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder .</seg>
        <seg id="31">The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32">However , the researchers had provided pieces of wire .</seg>
        <seg id="33">All four birds used the wire to form a hook and used the hook to fish the bucket out of the tube by its handle .</seg>
        <seg id="34">Three of the four rooks even managed it at the first attempt .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="3">Here is advice for proceeding : Gently excise this page and make it your bookmark .</seg>
        <seg id="4">You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Englund 's novelistic telling , and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS , a beacon during those few moments when , like one of his men and women , you are confused and bereft in the fog of war .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="5">Mr . Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist .</seg>
        <seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy , which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature .</seg>
        <seg id="7">What he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti-history . "</seg>
        <seg id="8">It contains few big names , major treaties or famous battles ; there are almost no ambassadors , dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel .</seg>
        <seg id="9">It 's not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " It 's about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10"> " The Beauty and the Sorrow " threads together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers , doctors , ambulance drivers and clerks .</seg>
        <seg id="11">A few of these people will become heroes .</seg>
        <seg id="12">A few will become prisoners of war , or lose limbs , go mad or die .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Mr . Englund 's book is a deviation from standard history books .</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is a corrective too to the notion that World War I was only about the dire trench warfare on the Western Front .</seg>
        <seg id="16"> " The Beauty and the Sorrow " expertly pans across other theaters of war : the Alps , the Balkans , the Eastern Front , Mesopotamia , East Africa .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them ; one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="18">This is a moving book , almost from the start .</seg>
        <seg id="19">War floods these people 's lives like a natural catastrophe , a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite .</seg>

        <seg id="22">Almost no one understands what 's happening , even why this war is to be fought .</seg>
        <seg id="23"> " Lack of facts , " Mr. Englund observes , " has been padded out with guesses , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24"> " The Beauty and the Sorrow " follows individuals like Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian Army , and Richard Stumpf , a young German high-seas fleet seaman .</seg>
        <seg id="25">Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs , letters and other already published material .</seg>
        <seg id="26">The accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring , but are most fully alive in Mr. Englund 's accumulation of small moments , stray details .</seg>
        <seg id="27">Many of these are about deprivation and making do .</seg>
        <seg id="28">In telling a German schoolgirl 's story he says : " Ersatz , everywhere ersatz . "</seg>
        <seg id="29"> " Substitute coffee , fake aluminum , imitation rubber , paper bandages , wooden buttons . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">He goes on about the ersatz food in Germany .</seg>
        <seg id="31">He describes " meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel ; shoes soled with wood . "</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="33">Some stories are about honor and bravery .</seg>
        <seg id="34">One American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war : " You feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey , the evening paper or the best seller , and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front .

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Hundreds of police officers were involved , some of them wearing riot helmets .</seg>
        <seg id="3">The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park would be at its emptiest .</seg>
        <seg id="4">The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the Police Department .</seg>
        <seg id="6">There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks , like the pepper-spraying of protesters , that violated department rules and created a firestorm of public sympathy for the squatters .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out .</seg>
        <seg id="9">A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island , with an eye toward Zuccotti .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Officials increased so-called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The last training session was on Monday night , on the Manhattan side of the East River .</seg>
        <seg id="12">The orders to move into the park came down at the " last minute , " said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assignment only as " an exercise . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13"> " The few cops that I know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into Zuccotti Park , " said the person , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .</seg>
        <seg id="14"> " The only people who were aware of them going into Zuccotti Park were at the very highest levels of the department . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city .</seg>
        <seg id="16">On Oct . 14 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units , including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Mr . Kelly said many people , almost like commuters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in .</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , " he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Emergency Service Unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive , near the Manhattan Bridge , before moving out .</seg>
        <seg id="21">The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters .</seg>
        <seg id="22">As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light-blue windbreakers , many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">No tents were touched until 1 : 45 a.m. , the police said , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .</seg>
        <seg id="24">Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">Reporters in the park were forced to leave .</seg>
        <seg id="26">Paul J. Browne , the Police Department 's chief spokesman , said it was for their safety .</seg>
        <seg id="27">But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .</seg>
        <seg id="28">Mr . Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street , along the park 's western border , were able to capture images .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">As the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing , crews from the Sanitation Department followed , scooping up what was left behind .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out , the images appearing on the Internet soon after .</seg>
        <seg id="31">A core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment 's kitchen area , near the center of the park .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Some made a barrier , and the police moved in to methodically arrest them .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="33">About 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their arms .</seg>
        <seg id="34">And two people chained themselves to trees , Mr. Kelly said .</seg>
        <seg id="35">Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">No arrests were made in the park until about 3 : 30 a.m. , Mr. Kelly said .</seg>
        <seg id="37">The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">Mr . Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park .</seg>
        <seg id="39">Most of the arrests were for " disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , " he said .</seg>
        <seg id="40">The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito , the chief of department , the top uniformed officer in the department .</seg>
        <seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski , the department 's chief of detectives , was also there .</seg>
        <seg id="42">Mr . Kelly , while present , was " not directing operations , " Mr. Browne said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="43">A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway , between Liberty and Cedar Streets , in case they had to move in .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">Barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street , a block north of the park , and at Pine Street , a block south .</seg>
        <seg id="45">From those positions , the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from Zuccotti Park .</seg>
        <seg id="46">At one point , several officers , many with shields , were seen pushing people farther out .</seg>
        <seg id="47">About 28 people were on the northern perimeter .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="48">Some of the rowdiest action of the night took place south of the park .</seg>
        <seg id="49">Around 5 a.m. , south of Pine Street , one protester jumped on the hood of a police car , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Support Workers ' Union Will Sue City Over Layoffs</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday , claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union , District Council 37 , in its effort to reverse the layoffs .</seg>
        <seg id="4">Six hundred seventy-two school aides , parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city 's lowest paid lost their jobs on Oct . 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">City officials have categorically denied that accusation .</seg>
        <seg id="6">At a City Council hearing last month , Schools Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in June .</seg>
        <seg id="7">One council member fired back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">District Council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the Department of Education that it would be sued ; it will hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the lawsuit 's filing formally , in State Supreme Court in Manhattan .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The suit will list Mr. Walcott and the city 's Department of Education as defendants , and counts eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs , all of them black or Latino women , as were most of the aides who lost their jobs .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas , a spokeswoman for the city 's Law Department , said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times , the union has zeroed in on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment , saying poor schools lost more aides because they had been chronically underfinanced .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">It points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa , 17 school aides lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville , Brooklyn , and 46 were let go in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides employed by Public School 36 in Harlem , where 68 percent of the students live in poverty , the lawsuit says , " This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can fund-raise to make up the budget shortfalls . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">P.S. 36 " s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools enroll .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators .</seg>
        <seg id="16">The memo used the word " excess " to describe the action , even though " excess " more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school 's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17"> " Sixty-six parent coordinators were laid off , " the draft complaint says , " and not merely excessed . "</seg>

      </p>

      <p>
        <seg id="7">The language may sound innocuous , but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">This summer , lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the U.S. military 's role in the NATO mission in Libya .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">In June , Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin , and it never came up for a vote in the Senate .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">But on the same day that bill failed in the House , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya .</seg>
        <seg id="12">That left the U.S. mission in a form of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama 's handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the rug out from under it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Then Congress 's indecision was overtaken by events .</seg>
        <seg id="14">Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August , and Gaddafi was killed Oct . 20 .</seg>
        <seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended Oct . 31 .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Now the Senate may be ready to act .</seg>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">The resolution also " affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the June bill did ?</seg>

        <seg id="18">The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Military Faces Mounting Pressure to Crack Down on Rape</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">This week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape .</seg>
        <seg id="3">If not , hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Pfc . Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier .</seg>
        <seg id="5">It was October 2008 , and she was heading back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station , just north of San Diego , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer .</seg>
        <seg id="6">He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .</seg>
        <seg id="7"> " A red flag went up , " Lyman says .</seg>
        <seg id="8">But the Texas native brushed aside her concern .</seg>
        <seg id="9">I thought , no , he 's 19 .</seg>
        <seg id="10"> " He 's from Texas , " she says .</seg>
        <seg id="11"> " I wish I had listened to my instincts . "</seg>
        <seg id="12">Within minutes of entering Lyman 's room , the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and raping her , she alleges .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">This week , on Nov . 18 , Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Arlington , Va . , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , will go to trial .</seg>
        <seg id="14">The suit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape within the military , in violation of soldiers " constitutional rights .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Filed in February by Susan Burke , a Washington , D.C. , attorney , the suit initially involved 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosecute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Burke says she is going after the military 's top brass because the problem begins with them .</seg>
        <seg id="17"> " The military is a top-down structure , " she says .</seg>
        <seg id="18"> " Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? The top leadership . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Burke also says that since February , she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors , many of whom could be part of future suits .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Her strategy : rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">The defense team for the Department of Defense , led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride , has filed a motion to dismiss the case .</seg>
        <seg id="22">The court papers , obtained by Newsweek , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .</seg>
        <seg id="23">Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active-duty personnel .</seg>
        <seg id="24"> " The alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs " military service , " the documents say .</seg>
        <seg id="25">The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">Things have changed since the ' 50s .</seg>
        <seg id="27">While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .</seg>
        <seg id="28">In both Iraq and Afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .</seg>
        <seg id="29">The result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .</seg>
        <seg id="30">It 's time for the military to modernize as well , Burke says .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">She isn 't alone in her fight ; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers .</seg>
        <seg id="32">At Yale Law School , the Veterans " Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere .</seg>
        <seg id="33">Separately , the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the " personality disorder " diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence , according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women 's Action Network , a human-rights group .</seg>
        <seg id="34">Her group filed a suit in December against the Veterans Administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="35">Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .</seg>
        <seg id="36">In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the Department of Defense 's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office .</seg>
        <seg id="37">But assaults are notoriously underreported , and by the Pentagon 's own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year .</seg>
        <seg id="38">The report , released in March , also examines prosecution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="39">The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas .</seg>
        <seg id="40">In Lyman 's case , she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred .</seg>
        <seg id="41">That night , she says , she was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and commanders .</seg>
        <seg id="42">She did a rape kit , and her assailant 's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .</seg>
        <seg id="43">Six months later , in April 2009 , Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack .</seg>
        <seg id="44">Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was eventually acquitted .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="45"> " I remember the day when the verdict was read , " Lyman says .</seg>
        <seg id="46"> " I thought I was going to go into labor - I ran screaming from the courtroom . "</seg>
        <seg id="47"> " They put me into the psychiatric unit , and when I got out , I remember saying to my command officer , " That wasn 't his trial . That was my trial . " "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="48">Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .</seg>
        <seg id="49">In January 2010 she was discharged under less-than-honorable terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="50">As for whether the case filed by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs moves forward , it 's a long shot , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School .</seg>
        <seg id="51">However , he notes , " In my view they should be able to move forward . "</seg>
        <seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .</seg>
        <seg id="53">I 've been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine .</seg>
        <seg id="54">The military is decades behind because they don 't have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="55">He adds , " The odds are heavily against them ... but it 's important for them to try . "</seg>
        <seg id="56">These things only change when good people are willing to fight .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="57">If the hearing doesn 't go their way , Burke , the plaintiffs " lawyer , will cue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases .</seg>
        <seg id="58"> " We will continue battling the military on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .</seg>
        <seg id="59">Or until we die , whichever comes first .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Walls Have Eyes : How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe , Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online .</seg>
        <seg id="3">On Monday , Breivik , who admitted to a killing spree in Norway in July which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .</seg>
        <seg id="4">While Breivik may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cyberspace : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social-networking sites .</seg>
        <seg id="5">After this summer 's tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .</seg>
        <seg id="6">But how to find them ?</seg>
        <seg id="7">Easy - just log on to Facebook .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8"> " We realized that it wasn 't that difficult to get to them at all , " says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Facebook 's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic , says Bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the site 's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Bartlett 's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new band or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">By reaching out through Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office .</seg>
        <seg id="12"> " It 's quite a new way of doing research , " Bartlett says .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Some of the results aren 't all that surprising : online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .</seg>
        <seg id="14">But in something of a twist , " those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">DEMOS 's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Think tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in ' Likes ' , wall posts and status updates .</seg>
        <seg id="17">With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the Facebook " data supernova " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn 't approach with a clipboard on the street .</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " Before , when you tried to survey people from the British National Party , it would be very difficult to identify them . "</seg>
        <seg id="20"> " You 'd have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , " says Bartlett .</seg>
        <seg id="21"> " Facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle social-health problems .</seg>
        <seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .</seg>
        <seg id="24">Moreno suggests that students ' peers , such as residential advisors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boozy status updates .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " You can 't treat a problem if you can 't diagnose it , " Dimitri Christakis , Moreno 's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health , Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children 's Research Institute , told the Washington Post .</seg>
        <seg id="26"> " We 've found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Facebook , too , is constantly tapping into its own population for data .</seg>
        <seg id="28">The site 's Data Team has worked up stats on relationship status and Valentine 's Day , voter turnout in the 2010 midterms , and a National Happiness Index ( mainly using information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research . )</seg>
        <seg id="29">But Facebook 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">But what about when Facebook users become part of a survey they don 't even know about ?</seg>
        <seg id="31">While researchers have well-defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it 's a free-for-all .</seg>
        <seg id="32"> " I don 't think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles , " says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab , of a 2006 study he conducted using students ' public Facebook walls .</seg>
        <seg id="33"> " As far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="34">Then there 's the question of methodology .</seg>
        <seg id="35">Even offline , there 's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .</seg>
        <seg id="36">On Facebook , it 's impossible to know how much of a user 's profile information and wall posts are true .</seg>
        <seg id="37"> " What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things , " says Selwyn .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">Which is why , despite his years as a technology researcher , Selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .</seg>
        <seg id="39"> " There 's no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , " he says .</seg>
        <seg id="40"> " Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . "</seg>

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Anders Behring Breivik , the man who confessed to masterminding twin attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer , has described himself as a " resistance " fighter during his first public court appearance in Oslo .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3"> " I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar Norway , " he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people .</seg>
        <seg id="4"> " I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism . "</seg>
        <seg id="5"> " I acknowledge the acts but I do not plead guilty . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he " did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . "</seg>
        <seg id="7">For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik , who brought a pre-written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered police to hold Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">Around 30 survivors and victims " relatives attended the hearing .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .</seg>
        <seg id="11">All attended with the goal of moving toward closure .</seg>
        <seg id="12"> " I thought he seemed cold and inhuman , " one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK .</seg>
        <seg id="13"> " It was uncomfortable , but for me I moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie , Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Despite Breivik 's bizarre notion of being part of a larger " resistance " movement , the judge determined that he is not insane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices .</seg>

        <seg id="1">7 Lessons From the Lost Steve Jobs Interview , Showing at a Theater This Week</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Following the death of Steve Jobs on Oct . 5 , there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - singling out the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor .</seg>
        <seg id="3">But what Apple fans might find most revealing in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview dusted off in advance of special movie screenings in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows .</seg>
        <seg id="4">He was certainly a designer , dreamer and self-identified hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow-chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Back in 1995 , Bob Cringely was developing the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a rare , extended conversation .</seg>
        <seg id="6">At that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company NeXT , looking forward to the popular adoption of the Internet .</seg>
        <seg id="7">While a small portion of Cringely 's interview was used in Nerds , he says that the interview 's master copies went missing in shipping .</seg>
        <seg id="8">It was only following Jobs " death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director 's garage .</seg>
        <seg id="9">This footage , slightly re-edited , is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs : The Lost Interview , coming to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">For someone known to loathe in-depth interviews , Jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies .</seg>
        <seg id="11">And incredibly thoughtful .</seg>
        <seg id="12">At four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-second ruminations , where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts , aiming for precision .</seg>
        <seg id="13">There are also moments where Jobs " perfectionism rises to the surface , where he seems impatient about Cringely 's questions , nudging him to move faster towards issues or subplots of greater import .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Filmed before the era of Pixar , the iPod or the iPhone , there 's something eerily prescient about the Lost Interview , as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of computing .</seg>
        <seg id="15">It 's one thing to read posthumous appraisals of Jobs " career , but there 's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here , the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness .</seg>
        <seg id="16">He has a vision for the way things could be and should be .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Not long after spelling it all out here he went and did it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">A quick rundown of seven notable Lost Interview sequences :</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">On how he learned to run a business :</seg>
        <seg id="20"> " Throughout the years in business , I 'd always ask : " Why do you do things ? " and the answers you invariably get are : " Oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "</seg>
        <seg id="21">Nobody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .</seg>
        <seg id="22">That 's what I found .</seg>
        <seg id="23">Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple .</seg>
        <seg id="24">Baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">On pranking the Pope :</seg>
        <seg id="26">Jobs recounts the " Blue Box " that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .</seg>
        <seg id="27">The device has been widely written about before , but Jobs " euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is infectious .</seg>
        <seg id="28">He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one AT &amp; T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible .</seg>
        <seg id="29"> " We were wrapping things around the globe a half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , " Jobs says with a giggle .</seg>
        <seg id="30"> " We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "</seg>
        <seg id="31">Us two , we didn 't know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and I don 't think there would have ever been Apple without it .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and Wozniak nearly pulled of , ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope , while doing their very best impression of Henry Kissinger .</seg>
        <seg id="33">As various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat , the two burst into giggles just before the Pope himself was roused to come answer the phone .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="34">On falling in love with technology ( and cold-calling Bill Hewlett ) :</seg>
        <seg id="35">At the age of 12 , on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call .</seg>
        <seg id="36">Not long after their 20-minute phone conversation , Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard .</seg>
        <seg id="37"> " That made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . "</seg>
        <seg id="38">Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company 's Palo Alto research labs , where he saw " the first desktop computer ever made . "</seg>
        <seg id="39">It was as big as a suitcase , had a small cathode ray tube display , and I fell in love with it .</seg>
        <seg id="40">I would get a ride up to HP as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="41">On improvising innovation :</seg>
        <seg id="42">At several points in the interview , Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .</seg>
        <seg id="43">Early in his career , as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards , he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer .</seg>
        <seg id="44">Working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .</seg>
        <seg id="45">Later while at Apple , he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse :</seg>
        <seg id="46"> " I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] , and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer . "</seg>
        <seg id="47">Ninety days later , we had a mouse we could build for $ 15 that was incredibly reliable .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="48">On great companies losing steam :</seg>
        <seg id="49">Long before he led the revival of Apple , Jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .</seg>
        <seg id="50"> " Say you work at IBM or Xerox , so you make a better copier or printer , so what ? "</seg>
        <seg id="51">You have a monopoly of the market share , so the company 's not more successful .</seg>
        <seg id="52">Sales and marketing makes it more successful , so [ it 's those kinds of people ] who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum .</seg>
        <seg id="53">The product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products vs. bad products - the craftsmanship required .</seg>
        <seg id="54">That 's what happened at Xerox ...</seg>
        <seg id="55">Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry .</seg>
        <seg id="56">It could have been ten times its size , could have been the Microsoft of the 90s ...</seg>
        <seg id="57">They grabbed defeat from victory .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="58">On innovation as art form :</seg>
        <seg id="59"> " There 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product ... as you evolve that great idea , it changes and grows . "</seg>
        <seg id="60">You learn a lot about the subtleties of it .</seg>
        <seg id="61">There are tradeoffs you have to make - certain things you can 't make electrons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .</seg>
        <seg id="62">You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...</seg>
        <seg id="63">Ultimately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you 're doing .</seg>
        <seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal .</seg>
        <seg id="65">We 've always been shameless about stealing great ideas .</seg>
        <seg id="66">It 's part of what made the Macintosh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , poets , artists , zoologists , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .</seg>
        <seg id="67">If not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama 's healthcare law , two of its justices , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The occasion was last Thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .</seg>
        <seg id="4">One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by Congress last year , a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">The justices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 1 / 2-hour argument is expected in March , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement , who served as U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Clement 's law firm , Bancroft PLLC , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Another firm that sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the National Federation of Independent Business .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court 's conference over the case .</seg>
        <seg id="11">In attendance was , among others , Mitch McConnell , the Senate 's top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">The featured guests at the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">It 's nothing new : The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years .</seg>
        <seg id="14">And it 's nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules .</seg>
        <seg id="15">In fact , justices are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">If they were , they arguably fell under code 's Canon 4C , which states , " A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Nevertheless , the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18"> " This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said Bob Edgar , the president of Common Cause .</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " The justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court . "</seg>
        <seg id="20">Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society .</seg>
        <seg id="22">And Thomas " wife , Ginni , is a high-profile conservative activist .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="23">Moreover , conservatives argue that it 's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue , not Scalia and Thomas .</seg>
        <seg id="24">Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .</seg>
        <seg id="25">Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .</seg>
        <seg id="26">Kagan has given no indication she will do so .</seg>

        <seg id="3">Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">It 's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product .</seg>
        <seg id="5">But it 's a big deal when the company is airplane-maker Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a record $ 18 billion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">Just as big is where Boeing got the order : the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future airplane orders .</seg>
        <seg id="7">In a forecast released Monday , the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes worth $ 450 billion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Boeing over the weekend announced its biggest-ever order by dollar value for commercial airplanes - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets .</seg>
        <seg id="9">The blockbuster order came from Emirates airline in Dubai .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Then on Monday , Boeing said Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s , the so-called Dreamliner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .</seg>
        <seg id="12">List price for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations .</seg>
        <seg id="16">So , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a surge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it 's one of their biggest costs - is not as detrimental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .</seg>
        <seg id="17">That 's important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise , Dihora said .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Dire warnings from Pentagon over potential defense cuts</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta turned up the heat on Congress Monday , warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hallways of the Pentagon , to the battlefields of Afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The Pentagon already is digesting $ 450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4"> " The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , " Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain , R-Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina .</seg>
        <seg id="5">He said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger 23 % across-the-board reductions and a halt to many new projects .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6"> " Such a large cut , applied in this indiscriminate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts , " Panetta wrote to the senators .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7"> " We would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel involuntarily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to meet the target . "</seg>
        <seg id="8"> " These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The cuts would eventually hit combat troops , Panetta said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10"> " While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester , war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets , " Panetta warned .</seg>
        <seg id="11"> " Contracting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract oversight that support the war . "</seg>
        <seg id="12"> " Payroll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to wartime vendors , and legal and policy support would be disrupted . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">The two senators had written Panetta 10 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14"> " The consequence of a sequester on the Defense Department would set off a swift decline of the United States as the world 's leading military power . "</seg>
        <seg id="15"> " We are staunchly opposed to this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta 's letter .</seg>
        <seg id="16"> " This is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . "</seg>
        <seg id="17"> " The sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States , and it should not be allowed to occur . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Whether the Panetta letter and the fresh warnings from Senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts , although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">At a news conference last week , the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .</seg>
        <seg id="21"> " It 's a ship without sailors . "</seg>
        <seg id="22"> " It 's a brigade without bullets . "</seg>
        <seg id="23"> " It 's an air wing without enough trained pilots . "</seg>
        <seg id="24"> " It 's a paper tiger , an Army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " It 's a force that suffers low morale , poor readiness and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries . "</seg>
        <seg id="26"> " In effect , it invites aggression .. "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham , Panetta spelled out new specifics of how reductions " generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .</seg>
        <seg id="29">That list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new bomber , the next-generation ballistic submarine , the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Marines need to replace the humvee .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">Halting further development and testing the F35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from China and other rivals .</seg>

        <seg id="4">Administrators at Penn State have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone asserting to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar .</seg>
      </p>

        <seg id="6">Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries .</seg>
        <seg id="7">New York congressman and Internet flasher Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence .</seg>
        <seg id="8">Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover-up of an extramarital affair .</seg>
        <seg id="9">And then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife .</seg>
        <seg id="11">There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">How much deceit do we encounter ?</seg>
        <seg id="14">On a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Now granted , many of those are white lies .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">Detecting lies , or " lie spotting , " is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Far from being a parlor game similar to , say , charades , where the object is to exclaim , " Gotcha , " deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects , especially in psychology and physiology .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">One result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been debunked .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Liars do look you in the eye .</seg>
        <seg id="21">They do not always stutter , stammer , blush or fidget .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Don 't conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and difficult to unmask .</seg>
        <seg id="23">A trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , facial micro-expressions , question formation and timing .</seg>
        <seg id="24">I spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , interviewing , negotiating or managing .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">Good liars are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts , that men tell more " self-oriented " lies while women tell more " other-oriented " lies -- usually to protect someone 's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " whoppers " ) .</seg>
        <seg id="27">We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer , others will feel less guilt in lying to you .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">How do you tell if someone is lying ?</seg>
        <seg id="29">First , observe your subject 's normal behavior .</seg>
        <seg id="30">This is called " baselining . "</seg>
        <seg id="31">It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Observe your subject 's posture , laugh , vocal quality .</seg>
        <seg id="33">You 'd better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you don 't make unjust accusations when you see foot-tapping in the middle of the meeting .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="34">Then look for clusters of deceptive verbal and nonverbal behaviors .</seg>
        <seg id="35">Consider these clusters red flags , not proof of deception .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">Deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit " post-interview relief " -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over .</seg>
        <seg id="37">Interrogators often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-interview relief .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">Also , pay attention to your subject 's language .</seg>
        <seg id="39">Scott Peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a nationwide search for her .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="40">Deceptive individuals might also use distancing language : " I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky " or repeat a hard question in its entirety .</seg>
        <seg id="41">The most common verbal indicators are subtle .</seg>
        <seg id="42">Someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a hard question : " Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge . "</seg>
        <seg id="43">This renders the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">There 's no magic bullet for detecting lies , but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="45">These skills will enhance anyone 's chances of avoiding victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives .</seg>

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it 's willing to reroute the project to get it back on track .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">TransCanada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska , and is confident the project will still win approval .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol .</seg>
        <seg id="5">TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">That comes after the State Department 's announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer , a vast underground water supply .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7"> " This is a real path forward , " Rep. Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska , told Fox News .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">The new environmental review ordered by the State Department likely would push off any decision until 2013 , after next year 's elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">Obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the State Department 's call , and expressed support for it .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">The 1,700-mile pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .</seg>
        <seg id="11">It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas .</seg>
        <seg id="12">To do so would require it crossing six states .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">It is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups , who have banked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer , a major source of drinking water and irrigation .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">The State Department 's current Environmental Impact Study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , centering on two questions .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="16">One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada , Paul Elliott , who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .</seg>

        <seg id="8">Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factorial , for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes , director at the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken .</seg>
        <seg id="9"> " What we 're seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint imposed by the legislation that passed in the Congress in order to combat money laundering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something " he said .</seg>

        <seg id="11">Lopez Cervantes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor .</seg>
        <seg id="12"> " The number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the United States has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to rise , " he said .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">The labor market analysis of Sinaloa gets worse when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions , according to INEGI , 60.38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .</seg>
        <seg id="15">In addition to the unemployment and informality , another state labor reminder is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare .</seg>
        <seg id="16">The monthly average income of Sinaloa workers was , until September , 5.352 pesos , well below the national average , that is of 7.375 pesos .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="21">Against the backdrop of economic downturn , the state government asked in July during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities , in order to reactivate the economy , the local congressional approval was for a total of 2.600 million pesos , and until November no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .</seg>

      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The Supreme Court of Justice ( SCJ ) rejected the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree that brings forward the so-called " digital television transition " from 2021 to 2015 , since the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Court , Juan Silva Meza , considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">With this result , the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate , was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree , and this remains in force .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The sentence project prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero , proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission ( Cofetel ) , in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Only Zaldivar , Jorge Mario Pardo , Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">With this argument , both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree , and to support the claims , the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">At the ministers " meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Deputies , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">In his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11"> " Nor do I consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body , " and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive , who has a constitutional mandate , the guidance of the State .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better utilization of the radio-electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Delaying the change , he said , would mean delaying the benefits of digitization , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , " as it covers economic , social , political and national security issues . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">These issues , he said , " require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic stewardship , comprises a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the state executive power . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly specialized technical bodies .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">There cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the contested decree , that invades in any way the competence of the Congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Legislature , he said .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The possibility of counting " vote by vote " is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in Michoacán , where according to the data obtained from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program ( PERP ) the difference between the first and the second place of the governor 's election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 879 of the total 6.074 minutes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">In this regard , the President of the General Council of Michoacán Electoral Institute ( MEI ) , Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza , recalled that a few days ago , the last November 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmonize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">As it will be recalled , Michoacán did not authorize the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Justice Act , since the Congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gazette , arguing that he had some objections .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The same November 9th , the Supreme Court of Justice ( SCJ ) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as " invalid and illegal " the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right " to sanction or vote them . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Interviewed about the possibility of the " vote by vote , " Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the MEI it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Thus , the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">In addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">There should be noted that in this situation is the election of Morelia , where according to PERP the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.16 percent , even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Wednesday there will be formed the new Italian government</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">The appointed prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The designated Italian prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti , named on Sunday , will meet on Wednesday with the president , Giorgio Napolitano , to confirm that he can form a government .</seg>
        <seg id="5">He is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">Monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7"> " I want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , " said the former European commissioner to the reporters .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The " framework is now well delineated , " he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the normal , while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders in order to regain the confidence in Italy .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">Underlying the pressure on Monti to hurry , the instable markets put the yield of the Italian BTP bonds to 10-year above 7 percent , the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia , leader of the Italian employers ' Federation told the reporters after meeting with Monti : " We said we would support very much this government . "</seg>
        <seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Monti 's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi , who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16"> " We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good outcome , " said to the reporters Angelino Alfano , secretary of the center-right party .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">The support of the LDP , the largest party in Italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that Monti is forming .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Parliamentary support</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .</seg>
        <seg id="23">He will end his meeting on Tuesday night .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">After a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign , the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">Rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion Euros would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro zone .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013 , despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet , but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">Political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too .</seg>
        <seg id="11">This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great .</seg>
        <seg id="12">I 've been to Costa Rica only once , on vacation , it is a beautiful country and I think we 'll be able to stay a few days there .</seg>
        <seg id="13">So we are excited to bring our music there .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band ; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .</seg>
        <seg id="15">What do you say to your most fervent followers ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Thank you for staying with us through all these years .</seg>
        <seg id="17">It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Some of the biggest shows we 've played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .</seg>
        <seg id="21">We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica .</seg>
        <seg id="22">Really , we are very eager to play there .</seg>
        <seg id="23">We love this country , we love to surf and the jungle , for both things , Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible .</seg>
        <seg id="26">My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua , along with Mexico , these are great places to surf , and that 's how we learned about , through people who love surfing .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Viewing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs .</seg>
        <seg id="28">What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">As we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .</seg>
        <seg id="30">We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">You never repeat the repertoire .</seg>
        <seg id="32">How come ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="33">I think it 's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it 's difficult to choose which songs to play every night .</seg>
        <seg id="34">When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten .</seg>
        <seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="36">With this tour , you are celebrating 20 years of experience .</seg>
        <seg id="37">Looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">Yes , absolutely .</seg>
        <seg id="39">First , I think none of us could ever imagine we 'd be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream .</seg>
        <seg id="40">We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together .</seg>
        <seg id="41">We all love each other and love making music .</seg>
        <seg id="42">We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .</seg>
        <seg id="43">Things could not be better for us .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="44">What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="45">It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands .</seg>
        <seg id="46">We are good friends of the people of Soundgarden , Mudhoney and Alice in Chains .</seg>
        <seg id="47">It 's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .</seg>
        <seg id="48">From time to time , arises a band of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .</seg>
        <seg id="49">We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group .</seg>
        <seg id="50">I still play with some of them from time to time .</seg>
        <seg id="51">Last year , we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney , we saw Soundgarden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that aroused .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="52">It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="53">Yes , four of us were together for 21 years and Matt ( Cameron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands lasted .</seg>
        <seg id="54">First , I think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .</seg>
        <seg id="55">We are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment .</seg>
        <seg id="56">We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="57">Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .</seg>
        <seg id="58">How do you find a balance ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="59">As we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .</seg>
        <seg id="60">We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music .</seg>
        <seg id="61">While one remembers that people are there for the music , that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really cares about .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="62">How do you remember your other project Manother Love Bone ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="63">I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing .</seg>
        <seg id="64">We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of Andy ( Andrew Woods ) .</seg>
        <seg id="65">There were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bruce ( Fair-weather ) and Greg ( Gilmore ) , who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made ​ ​ me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , laugh , talk about music and football and much more .</seg>
        <seg id="66">It was a remarkable man and we miss him .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="67">The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica .</seg>
        <seg id="68">Is it true that you know its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and that 's why you chose it for the opening ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="69">Yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we 're anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="70">Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="71">That is a question for Ed ( Eddie Vedder ) , so I do not know .</seg>
        <seg id="72">He sings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="73">As a bassist , what are your influences ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="74">There are so many .</seg>
        <seg id="75">Within the first that come to my mind are Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C.J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ...</seg>
        <seg id="76">There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="77">How did Pearl Jam succeeded to maintain grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="78">I think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge .</seg>
        <seg id="79">When I think of it , it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before , like Mudhoney , Soundgarden , Nirvana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , I think it 's wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making now music better than ever .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="80">At first , your music had a darker content , and now has become more positive .</seg>
        <seg id="81">How do you explain this change ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="82">It 's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear lighter , but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .</seg>
        <seg id="83">With both , when Ed played them , I cried when I heard them , and these songs are profoundly dark .</seg>
        <seg id="84">I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me .</seg>
        <seg id="85">Also , I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">In mid 80 's at the height of the now extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona ( MCB ) , this Administration printed promotional leaflets of Collserola .</seg>
        <seg id="5">The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Moreover , it was accompanied by a comparison , in figures , with the New York Central Park .</seg>
        <seg id="7">On the death of the MCB , in 1987 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of Barcelona , ​ ​ being the Catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north-south but up ( mountain ) -down ( sea ) .</seg>
        <seg id="8">The classification of Collserola as a natural park redounds in this idea .</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reference was not Central Park , but Yellowstone , with the wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear .</seg>
        <seg id="10">This was all about until , in September , the council called for a mega competition composed of 16 contests for as many other doors to Collserola .</seg>
        <seg id="11">A door refers to the idea of the park , no doubt .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Either that or someone wants to put gates to the field .</seg>
        <seg id="13">The question comes alone : Collserola ? Park or mountain ?</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">The competition , both as for its merely organizational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona .</seg>
        <seg id="15">It 's almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator .</seg>
        <seg id="16">And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academics , which have been presented .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Miguel Roldan , Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona : the competition is appropriate</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">For Roland , after approaching the coastline becomes " necessary " to discuss about " the mountain front , " whenever Ildefons Cerda 's speech , that of green apples has not been carried out .</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach .</seg>
        <seg id="20">Among other things , for its great accessibility .</seg>
        <seg id="21">Collserola is more complex , " says the architect to whom the title of " gates of Collserola " contains a " lexical trap " : we should not think about them " as access to a park , but as the delimitation of some areas where we must act . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Modolo , as Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world , called the proposal " intellectual challenge " with " some dangers . "</seg>
        <seg id="23">Hazards arising from the " uncertainty of projecting the public space " after the experience of the 80 " s which had in the Forum area " his swan song . "</seg>
        <seg id="24">The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to build .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " Limiting something is setting up the next step , " meaning , overcoming .</seg>
        <seg id="26"> " We must think of new urban planning tools , because the current [ in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan ( GMP ) ] can lead to a real disaster . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Tighter to the question , Modolo believes that simplifying the Collserola valley side " can be understood as a park , Barcelona , ​ ​ not " by a purely topographical issue .</seg>
        <seg id="28">Modolo remembers that there is already a work done by the Board of Collserola that " should not fall on deaf ears , " although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project " from the very beginning . "</seg>
        <seg id="29">And further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but " he doubts " about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ( " a success , " he points ) that have had to create : " The architects should be only a tool . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex , because the contest rules lack a global view of Collserola : " 16 cross contests have been called -he says-on sea- mountain sense , but there is no longitudinal reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . "</seg>
        <seg id="31">This leads , at least in this case , to have chosen to participate in the 16 contests .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Otherwise , a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .</seg>
        <seg id="33">In your opinion , the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .</seg>

        <seg id="5">He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .</seg>
        <seg id="6">He also said that the investigations made ​ ​ in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7"> " In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="13">At the press conference , the owner of the SCT , Perez Jacome , listed six important elements in the investigation :</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Visual flight :</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Weather Conditions :</seg>
        <seg id="17">AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Selected routes :</seg>
        <seg id="19">It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Location of the impact .</seg>
        <seg id="21">The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Dispersion of wreckage on a small area :</seg>
        <seg id="23">The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .</seg>
        <seg id="24">The dispersion of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion :</seg>
        <seg id="26">On the area of the accident there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft , some kind of explosion or fire .</seg>
        <seg id="27">Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">During the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9.200 feet above mean sea level , the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">The pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft , which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .</seg>

        <seg id="3">The Mexican Social Security Institute ( MSSI ) has announced that conducts a research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people , called the protocol of ' Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence ' , which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">In a statement , the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of Specialties Hospital , XXI Century National Medical Center , Miguel Cruz Lopez , explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , nutritionists and social workers .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health ( NIPH ) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies ( Cinvestav ) National Polytechnic Institute ( NPI ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the MSSI in the Valley of Mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children , every Saturday from 8 : 00 o 'clock .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc sports unit ( West Mexico State ) and since October 8th , the activity takes place in the Netzahualcoyotl Sport unit ( East State of Mexico ) .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="8">Once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit ( South the Mexico City ) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit ( North the Mexico City ) .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="9">He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">On November 14th , there will be celebrated the World Diabetes Day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="12">He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements ( weight , height , and waist circumference ) , blood pressure measurements , and determination of glucose , triglycerides , cholesterol and insulin and genetic ( seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Health Surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were obese , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic rise , " said the specialist of the MSSI .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">He said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">He reported that on average , the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage , 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">He explained that generally , the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume ( calories ) and which is stored as fat .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">Even , he said , the presence of dark-colored folds ( acanthuses ) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="21">Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that cause overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases : sedentary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>

        <seg id="1">UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Rafael Herrera , a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM , develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">If the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valley of Mexico , said Rafael Herrera Najera , a researcher at the Chemistry Faculty ( CF ) of the UNAM , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , the potholes could be reduced or even completely eliminated .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">In his lecture A technological view of the pothole , issued under the International Year of Chemistry , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of potholes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt , the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules , some of high molecular weight , called asphaltenes , and other of low molecular weight , called maltenes , which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees , it behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C , its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile , he said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asphalt .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt , composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Each of the stones which compose this covering , he said , is dipped with asphalt .</seg>
        <seg id="12">When driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement .</seg>
        <seg id="13">If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">On the asphalt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made ​ ​ of a fine stone material , meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">As being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">The weather , especially humidity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">When the ground is wet , water diffuses inside the covering and it 's hard to get out , this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of potholes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">In the formation of a pothole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and , therefore , the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of potholes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt , for example , asphalt emulsions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with easiness and without using high temperatures .</seg>

        <seg id="3">The Valley gets its title number 14 of princess .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="4">Once again Cauca Valley remains with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia .</seg>
        <seg id="5">This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium , wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">With the result obtained last night in Cartagena , where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter , the department counts with 14 Princess titles and Melina joins the legion of women of Valley of Cauca who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses , among them Miriam Ospina Benoit ( 1947 ) , Clara Borrero Dominguez ( 1949 ) , Patricia Bellini Ayala ( 1979 ) , Lorena Álvarez ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alzate ( 1983 ) , Olga Maria Arenas ( 1987 ) , Leila Blanque ( 1988 ) , Monica Evers ( 1989 ) , Maria Consuela Pinedo ( 1990 ) , Diana Isabel Romero ( 1993 ) , Giselle Aljure Garcés ( 2000 ) , Catalina Giraldo ( 2007 ) , Stephanie Garcés Aljure ( 2008 ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Now the big question many are asking is :</seg>
        <seg id="8">What was missing ? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia , not in vain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue , titles that were obtained by queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro , who took the crown of Miss Colombia .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">The first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question " ' What is the book that has marked you and why ? Asked ​ ​ by Martin Murillo Gomez from the Literary Cart Let 's read .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">To the questioner she answered</seg>
        <seg id="11"> " I read a lot , I believe a lot in literature , I think it is a form of culturalization , and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is " The little Prince ' is a pretty deep book .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Today I read " Crime and Punishment ' it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now I 'm reading the book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a beautiful book called " The heat of blood . '</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">A response that the jury did not like due to the term " culturalization ' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her .</seg>
        <seg id="14">But after the ceremony Melina said she was calm and happy with the result " the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . "</seg>
        <seg id="15">And for you all , please read a little bit , ' The Little Prince ' it is a great book "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Among the launched hypotheses it is said that Valley got burned by favoritism .</seg>
        <seg id="17">A reporter from Bogota suggested that for being the preferred , the acclaimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( Oster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional costume , and Mother Queen ) , " that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates , stressed the queen and therefore she did not shine on stage .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">And that was noted in her first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlántico representatives did show .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="20">Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the program " Like home ' , of the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was designated as princess " means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen . "</seg>
        <seg id="21">In addition , Valley lately avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest .</seg>
        <seg id="23">This is why , two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24"> " Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , " she said .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">There is also a speculation that Valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen , but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate ' natural beauty ' with the healthier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">The coach of the queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body , that there were better , " but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen , which for me was not very noticeable , made her lose points the last day . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Meanwhile , the journalist Guido Hoyos , of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered .</seg>
        <seg id="28"> " The surgeries are fine , but Valley did not know how to do them .</seg>
        <seg id="29">Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30">For this award , which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Contest , after the swimsuit parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the flicker that Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="31">Reality or not , the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as a princess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself .</seg>
        <seg id="32">However , she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena , found difficulties in getting the crown .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the Manhattan Square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">Hundreds of protesters crowded round the Zuccotti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows " the angry persons " to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6"> " Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti , and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations , " said one of the spokesmen of the movement " Occupy Wall Street , " Mark Bray .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">Bray explained that the response of the " angry persons " to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg , came to court , where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">In addition , the " angry persons " proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue , near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jersey , owned by the parish of Trinity Church .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">At least for one hour they were able to occupy the place , but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters , although Bray could not confirm the precise number , while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="10">The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Meanwhile , Zuccotti square , which is a privately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">Some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guarding the place , which led to " some small confrontations , " said Bray , who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">The court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupy Wall Street and enforce " laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re-install with camping shops and sleeping bags .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">The councilman personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square carried out at dawn , an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were " violating the law . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming " a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others " as " Some businesses had received threats ' and neighbors feared " for the quality of life . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17"> " The evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers , " added the spokesman of the movement , who accused the mayor of " disrespect for the freedom of expression .

      <p>
        <seg id="18">The responsible of " Occupy Wall Street " also indicated that they intend to organize " great deeds " for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commemorate the last two months of protests , which began on September 17th .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="2">GDP grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in March</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">Since last March , the Japanese economy was paralyzed , still recovering from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastrophe suffered by the Nippon country since the Second World War .</seg>
        <seg id="4">The first estimates of Tokyo government regarding the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have dimmed .</seg>
        <seg id="5">After three consecutive quarters of declines , the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September helped to turn the page , definitely : GDP increased by 1.5 % compared to the previous quarter and by 6 % in annualized rate .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The one recorded in the second quarter , for the Japanese the Fiscal Year begins in March 2012 - represents also the fastest rhythm of growth from January to March 2010 .</seg>
        <seg id="7">The recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami .</seg>
        <seg id="8">In fact , companies increased their investment by 1.1 % versus 0.9 % decline in capital expenditures which was observed from January to March , the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="9">However , the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthen-or rebuild-infrastructure , using of gaps to grow from scratch .</seg>
        <seg id="10">Japan has awakened , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 60 % of the Japanese GDP .</seg>
        <seg id="11">This variable climbed 1 % , driven by the increase of expenditure for cars , travels and leisure activities .</seg>

      </p>

        <seg id="14">With a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Toyota or Sony , for example , blamed the yen for their weak results between July and September .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">As markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU , the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard .</seg>
        <seg id="17"> " We must be vigilant to the risks that remain , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , " said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy , Motohisa Furukawa .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">And indeed , the perspectives are not encouraging .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development ( OECD ) said that most member countries showed in September clear signs of economic slowdown .</seg>
        <seg id="20">The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">The standing ovation lasting several minutes which they , Angela Merkel and then a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , the very Europhile Minister of Finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for doubt .</seg>
        <seg id="7">The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion , is embodied in the slogan " the right response to the crisis is not less Europe , but more Europe . "</seg>

        <seg id="11">This is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schäuble .</seg>

        <seg id="14">Similarly , the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country-Member of the directorate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Anxious to calm the climate in her party , the Chancellor increased the number of her references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the " small " European countries , or of countries in difficulty , which are quick to criticise " arrogant " Germany .</seg>

        <seg id="8">And which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the imposition on public employees of one day 's wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days ' wait by private employees ) .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">As in other cases , the effects of the announcement appear a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate-related fraud .</seg>
        <seg id="12">This has actually been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offensives , which have usually borne fruit .</seg>

        <seg id="13">The French are no sicker than people elsewhere in Europe .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Let us first of all look at the national figures .</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to the Caisse nationale d 'assurance maladie ( CNAM ) , over 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006 .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">According to l 'Institut de Recherche et de Documentation en Economie de la Santé , the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 11,3 thousand million Euros , was 5 % of total health expenditure .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Of this sum , 46 % concerned maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 % sick leave benefit at 6,2 thousand million Euros .</seg>
        <seg id="18">And therefore represented 2,5 % of health-related expenditure .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">The French spent an average of 14,5 days on sick leave in 2010 , compared with 17.8 days in 2009 , according to a study by Alma Consulting Group .</seg>
        <seg id="20">An average , which conceals certain divergences ; another inquiry published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site , showed that 75 % of the 40 000 French employees questioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">Another study , this time concerning sickness insurances , states that in 2010 , 37 % of sick leave lasted less than 8 days , 15 % 15 days to one month , 15 % from one to three months and 11 % lasted longer .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Comparing these figures with those of their European neighbours , French employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country .</seg>
        <seg id="23">A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global rate of absence from work in France ( for reasons of health or not ) fluctuated between 10 % and 11 % , compared with between 20 % and 28 % in Denmark , 15 % in the United Kingdom , or between 16 % and 18 % in The Netherlands .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">Sickness certificate-related fraud is very low , compared with " black " labour .</seg>
        <seg id="25">As regards fraud , it is very low .</seg>
        <seg id="26">The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">In 2008 , out of 1,5 million controls , the CNAM found that 13 % of the 285 000 controls on short-term sickness certificates were " unjustified , " or too long , " equal to 37 050 cases .</seg>
        <seg id="28">In the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 45 days , 11 % cases were found to be " inappropriate or unjustified " out of 1,2 million , equal to 132 000 .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">In total therefore , 169 000 cases were " unjustified , " out of several million of employees issued with certificates .</seg>
        <seg id="30">A figure which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the " black " labour figure .</seg>
        <seg id="31">According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian , author of a report on the subject in June , this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million Euros annual tax shortfall , equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud .</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">Regarding palliative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care , apart from cancer cases .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Canadian society is half dead .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Only 9 % of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="6">This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .</seg>
        <seg id="7">This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">At the outset , the experts cite a recent inquiry by the Economist Intelligence Unit , which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Whilst Canada is placed 10th , the study notes that " the medicalisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">Medicalisation or not , 77 % of Canadians do not have access to palliative care , report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada .</seg>
        <seg id="11">And 86 % of them end by dying in hospital</seg>
        <seg id="12">Countrywide , it is in Quebec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">On the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="14">Now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised , there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of euthanasia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not consenting .</seg>
        <seg id="15">On the contrary , affirmed during a teleconference , Jocelyn Downie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16"> " Euthanasia is practised in Canada , where it is clearly illegal . "</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Canadians in favour of euthanasia</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19">It should be remembered that 85 % of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia , because according to an Angus Reid enquiry in 2010 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering .</seg>
        <seg id="20">And the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value .</seg>
        <seg id="21">Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .</seg>
        <seg id="23">They also suggest among their other recommendations , that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal .</seg>
        <seg id="24">The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="25">Regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments , nursing institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="26">Lastly , concerning palliative sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">Reservations of other experts</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="28">Certain experts in the field of the health-related legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts ' report .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">Maître Pierre Deschamps , a specialist in health legislation , described as " extreme " the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="30"> " This opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says Me Deschamps , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .</seg>
        <seg id="31">Me Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society</seg>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <seg id="6">On that date , Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the Japanese currency , which was setting a new record of strength since 1945 .</seg>

        <seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .</seg>
        <seg id="5">It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power .</seg>
        <seg id="6">The debate will not be fruitful , unless it explores all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .</seg>
        <seg id="7">The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">Now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 , unless a huge proportion of the world 's population is deprived of a vital element .</seg>
        <seg id="9">During the same period , it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance , a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters .</seg>
        <seg id="11">This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .</seg>
        <seg id="12">This is not the case of Belgium , which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of Switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="13">On the other hand , Great Britain , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India , Brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .</seg>
        <seg id="14">The United States , decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident .</seg>
        <seg id="15">Although the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradicts that argument .</seg>
        <seg id="16">The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas , in particular from Russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .</seg>
        <seg id="17">In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">The case of Denmark should be considered .</seg>
        <seg id="19">Champion of Europe in the construction of turbines , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to intermittent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average .</seg>
        <seg id="20">On the other hand , thanks to the constancy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than French households .</seg>
        <seg id="21">Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe .</seg>
        <seg id="22">Due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render illusory the fine declarations on re-industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .</seg>
        <seg id="23">A price , which a large majority of the French refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="24">It should be recalled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting ones .</seg>
        <seg id="25">Strongly export-oriented , it attracts a galaxy of specialised RME 's in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .</seg>
        <seg id="26">If France decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these RME 's and lose the annual 6 thousand million Euro 's worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services .</seg>
        <seg id="27">What electrician would recommend a EPR designed to function for sixty years , if the decline of its manufacture was programmed ?</seg>
        <seg id="28">To solve the energy equation , it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="29">The development by Areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .</seg>
        <seg id="30">For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .</seg>
        <seg id="31">In France , we have a safety authority , which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Flamanville .</seg>
        <seg id="32">Our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accustomed to the same safety-related obsession .</seg>
        <seg id="33">In a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .</seg>
        <seg id="34">Only one , Three Mile Island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .</seg>
        <seg id="35">At Tchernobyl , the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error brought about the drama .</seg>
        <seg id="36">At Fukushima , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .</seg>
        <seg id="37">The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predecessors .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and French and German constructors , the EPR presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .</seg>
        <seg id="39">Since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy .</seg>
        <seg id="40">It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion , dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .</seg>

        <seg id="3">More recently , it is administrative harassment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( " Libération " on 23 May ) declaring that France " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "</seg>
        <seg id="4">But it is only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject .</seg>
        <seg id="6">On the Right , the tone was set by Jacques Chirac , who declared in 1976 that " 900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , " and on the Left by Michel Rocard explaining in 1990 that France " cannot accommodate all the world 's misery . "</seg>

      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="8">In 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right .</seg>
        <seg id="9">Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society .</seg>
        <seg id="10">The only difference resides in the degree of generosity , which one deigns to grant to immigrants .</seg>
        <seg id="11">In his programme , François Hollande confines himself to banalities , saying that co-development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="12">This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .</seg>
        <seg id="13">As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron , remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration ( Exceptional People : How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future , mai 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .</seg>
        <seg id="14">Restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages .</seg>
        <seg id="16">But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replacements of , local labour , exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour .</seg>
        <seg id="17">Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .</seg>

        <seg id="2">Democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .</seg>
        <seg id="3">The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the XXth century the tragedies of the World War , of totalitarisms , the Holocaust , the gulag , but also Franco in Spain , Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece .</seg>
        <seg id="4">Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="5">It is known that since the time of Napoleon it was a matter of faculty of thinking .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Universal suffrage , in order to be the sine qua non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a " tool of oppression " as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot .</seg>
        <seg id="7">No , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the Lumieres , economic and social solidarity , justice .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="8">The European crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .</seg>
        <seg id="9">In this respect , the palinode of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value , that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy , but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity .</seg>
        <seg id="10">This ambivalence must be thought through , in order that it can be bypassed .</seg>
        <seg id="11">The truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction .</seg>

        <seg id="14">No , we do not want the blades of a guillotine , but an exercise , joint , serene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on European level .</seg>
        <seg id="15">There are no crises in Greece , Italy , Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe .</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="16">In recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by Boko Haram and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by Aqmi .</seg>

        <seg id="2">The North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , has been commissioned .</seg>
        <seg id="3">It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Gazprom , the giant Russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a " bang . "</seg>
        <seg id="5">Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic , between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet , in the inauguration of North Stream , the new gasduct , which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea .</seg>
        <seg id="6">Symbolically , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev , the French prime minister François Fillon and his Dutch opposite number Mark Rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="7">With this new gasduct , 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania .</seg>
        <seg id="8">A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption .</seg>
        <seg id="9">And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">For Gazprom , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .</seg>
        <seg id="11">The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States .</seg>
        <seg id="12">The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( Poland or the Ukraine ) .</seg>
        <seg id="13">These two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets .</seg>
        <seg id="14">At the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new " German-Soviet pact , " referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939 .</seg>
        <seg id="15">That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="16">By supporting this Russian project , Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .</seg>
        <seg id="17">But at the price of depriving Europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .</seg>
        <seg id="18">Russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="19"> " This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia , it is a new artery which links us organically , " confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .</seg>
        <seg id="20">All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom , present in large numbers at Lubmin , the point of arrival of the gas .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="21">The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit .</seg>
        <seg id="22">The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships ' anchors .</seg>
        <seg id="23">Ir rests on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .</seg>
        <seg id="24">To construct it , it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War .</seg>
        <seg id="25"> " A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution , " says Jens Müller , spokesman of North Stream company .</seg>
        <seg id="26">It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="27">The pipeline is a long metal serpent , of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .</seg>
        <seg id="28">A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores .</seg>
        <seg id="29"> " In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , " states Jens Müller .</seg>
        <seg id="30">In the case of a leak , the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air .</seg>
        <seg id="31">But this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="32">The surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct .</seg>
        <seg id="33">Being cigar-shaped , it is introduced inside the 1-metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .</seg>
        <seg id="34">On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal deformation .</seg>
        <seg id="35">The gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .</seg>
        <seg id="36">The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .</seg>
        <seg id="37">This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="38">Five companies combined their forces to implement this project .</seg>
        <seg id="39">The leader remains Gazprom , which holds 51 % of the shareholding .</seg>
        <seg id="40">The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF ( 15.5 % each ) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez ( 9 % each ) .</seg>
        <seg id="41">These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream , delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct .</seg>
        <seg id="42">It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .</seg>
        <seg id="43">Gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .</seg>
        <seg id="44"> " Gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , " states Jens Müller .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="45">The financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by Bank loans .</seg>
        <seg id="46">The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million Euros for the two pipelines .</seg>
        <seg id="47">The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 millions .</seg>
        <seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since Gazprom assumes the entire risk .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="49">The gasduct emerges from the Baltic sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers .</seg>
        <seg id="50">4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit .</seg>
        <seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gasducts .</seg>
        <seg id="52">Since last Tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour .</seg>
        <seg id="53">At full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Moleskine , a brand card .</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company , Moleskine will restore the taste of writing .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="3">It is a scent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle .</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Moleskine notebook is easily recognised , by its black rectangular cover , its elastic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Nevertheless , the Moleskine notebook as we know it today , was born in 1997 .</seg>
        <seg id="6">The Italian company Modo Modo , based in Milan , decided to launch a designer notebook .</seg>
        <seg id="7">Maria Sebregondi , then a consultant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .</seg>
        <seg id="8">The notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches , for example .</seg>
        <seg id="9">This type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers .</seg>
        <seg id="10"> " Moleskine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an avantgarde artists ' icon up to the XXth century , " related Maria Sebregondi , who has since become the manager of the brand name at Modo Modo .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="11">Success is there .</seg>
        <seg id="12">Between 2006 and 2010 , sales rose by 25 % to reach 12.7 million units .</seg>
        <seg id="13">One has travelled far from the production of the first years , when only 3000 notebooks were made .</seg>
        <seg id="14">Moleskine is crossing the Italian frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries , from France to the USA .</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the notebook attracts equally a businessman , a student and a professional .</seg>
        <seg id="16">Moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan , open-minded and cultivated .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="17">The small Italian company , which had only 12 employees at the start , now has almost 100 and two offices , one in Milan and the other in New York .</seg>
        <seg id="18">Its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .</seg>
        <seg id="19"> " We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , notwithstanding the rise of e-mail , " explains Maria Sebregondi .</seg>
        <seg id="20">This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook .</seg>
        <seg id="21">In August , it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22">Exploiting its success and the cultural aura , Moleskine diversified its products to include handbags , pens , computer bags . The brand includes every kind of support .</seg>
        <seg id="23">A success , which aroused envy ; in the autumn of 2006 , Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe , now Syntegra Capital , to write a new page in the history of Moleskine .</seg>

        <seg id="1">Why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped workers so high ?</seg>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <seg id="2">Some 19 % of handicapped persons are looking for work .</seg>
        <seg id="3">The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped starts today .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="4">Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005 , the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average , namely 19 % , versus 9 % for the population as a whole .</seg>
        <seg id="5">Discouraging ?</seg>
        <seg id="6"> " No , stresses Eric Blanchet , Director-General of Adapt , the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped . "</seg>
        <seg id="7"> " The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable . "</seg>
        <seg id="8"> " At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high . "</seg>
        <seg id="9"> " There is however still a huge amount to do . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="10">It must be said that for the handicapped , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .</seg>
        <seg id="11">They are rather old : 37 % are over 50 ( 17 % on average ) .</seg>
        <seg id="12">They have rather a low level of qualifications ; 80 % do not have the " bac " and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handicapped .</seg>
        <seg id="13">Lastly , long-term unemployment is very widespread , being 85 % for the handicapped versus 38 % on an average .</seg>
        <seg id="14">Briefly , all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem , " according to Christian Grapin , director-general of Tremplin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="15">Here are some of the brakes .</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities , which do change , but too slowly .</seg>
        <seg id="17">A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap , " with an " over-representation of persons in wheelchairs , psychically or intellectually deficient persons . "</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="18">Result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6 % of handicapped workers , fixed by a law dating back to 1987 .</seg>
        <seg id="19">The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6 % .</seg>
        <seg id="20"> " We are now on around 3 % , " says Pierre Blanc , director-general of the Agefiph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .</seg>
        <seg id="21">Proof : The number of " taxed " establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 606 to 480 million Euros ) .</seg>
      </p>
      <p>
        <seg id="22"> " The law of 2005 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains Pierre Blanc . "</seg>
        <seg id="23"> " But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . "</seg>
        <seg id="24">According to the ministry of employment , only 59 % of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons , versus 82 % of companies employing between 100 and 199 persons .</seg>
