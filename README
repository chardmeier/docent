DOCENT -- DOCUMENT-LEVEL LOCAL SEARCH DECODER FOR PHRASE-BASED SMT
==================================================================
Christian Hardmeier
13 August 2012

Docent is a decoder for phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
Unlike most existing SMT decoders, it treats complete documents, rather than
single sentences, as translation units and permits the inclusion of features
with cross-sentence dependencies to facilitate the development of
discourse-level models for SMT. Docent implements the local search decoding
approach described by Hardmeier et al. (EMNLP 2012).

SNOWBALL STEMMER LICENSE
========================
Docent contains code from the Snowball stemmer library downloaded from
http://snowball.tartarus.org/ (in external/libstemmer_c). This is what
the Snowball stemmer website says about its license (as of 4 Sep 2012):

"All the software given out on this Snowball site is covered by the BSD License
(see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html ), with Copyright (c)
2001, Dr Martin Porter, and (for the Java developments) Copyright (c) 2002,
Richard Boulton.

Essentially, all this means is that you can do what you like with the code,
except claim another Copyright for it, or claim that it is issued under a
different license. The software is also issued without warranties, which means
that if anyone suffers through its use, they cannot come back and sue you. You
also have to alert anyone to whom you give the Snowball software to the fact
that it is covered by the BSD license.

We have not bothered to insert the licensing arrangement into the text of the
Snowball software."

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================
Building docent can be a fairly complicated process because of its library
dependencies and the fact that it links against Moses and shares some of its
dependencies with it.

1. Installing prerequisite components

Download the following software components and build and install them into
directories of your choice according to the build instructions provided with
each package:

- cmake (build system)
	Version tested: 2.8.4
	Source: http://www.cmake.org/

	Make sure you have cmake in your PATH.

- Arabica (XML parser)
	Version tested: 2010-November
	Source: http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/arabica/code

	Arabica relies on the presence of a low-level XML parser such as expat.

- Boost (C++ library)
	Version tested: 1.48.0
	Source: http://www.boost.org/

	Watch out, many Linux boxes have old versions of boost lying around in
	system-wide directories. Make sure that the build process picks up headers
	and libraries from the same, reasonably recent version, and that Moses
	gets built with the same Boost version as docent.

- Moses (DP beam search decoder)
	Version tested: eb4bd5c85d8c71e47f5d1473ae31196a51ee9f35
	Source: https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git

	All the libraries you link into Moses will have to be linked into docent
	as well, so you should link as few libraries as possible. In particular,
	it's best to build Moses without srilm and irstlm. Docent will use the
	copy of kenlm built into Moses for it's own n-gram language model.

2. Installing Boost.Log

The required library Boost.Log isn't currently an official part of Boost.
Install it as follows:

- Get Boost.Log from its SVN repository:
    svn co https://boost-log.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/boost-log/trunk boost-log
- Make symbolic links from the boost-log directory to the boost directory:
    from $BOOST_LOG/boost-log/boost/log to $BOOST/boost/log
    from $BOOST_LOG/boost-log/libs/log  to $BOOST/libs/log
- In the regular boost directory, run
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./bjam

3. Building libstemmer

Libstemmer must be built separately, which is very simple:

- cd external/libstemmer_c
- make

4. Building docent

Docent can be built in a debuggable DEBUG and an optimised RELEASE
configuration. You will probably need both of them.
Start by editing the top-level configure script by adjusting the paths to boost,
moses and Arabica to your setup.

Then run (from the top directory):

- mkdir DEBUG RELEASE
- cd DEBUG
- ../configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
- make
- cd ../RELEASE
- ../configure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
- make

If you're lucky, this will leave you with a number of executables in the DEBUG
and RELEASE directories. If it fails, check whether all the required libraries
are found. This is the most likely cause of error.

USAGE
=====
1. File input formats

Docent accepts the NIST-XML and the MMAX formats for document input. Output is
always produced in the NIST-XML format. MMAX input requires you to provide both
a NIST-XML file and an MMAX directory, since the NIST-XML input file is used as
a template for the output.
NIST-XML output without MMAX can be used for models that process unannotated
plain text input. MMAX input can be used to provide additional annotations, e.g.
if the input has been annotated for coreference with a tool like BART
(http://www.bart-coref.org/).

2. Decoder configuration

The decoder uses an XML configuration file format. There are two example
configuration files in tests/config.
The <random> tag specifies the initialisation of the random number generation.
When it is empty (<random/>), a random seed value is generated and logged at the
beginning of the decoder run. In order to rerun a specific sequence of
operations (for debugging), a seed value can be provided as shown in one of the
example configuration files.
The only phrase table format currently supported is the binary phrase table
format of moses (generated with processPhraseTable). Language models should be
in KenLM's probing hash format (other formats supported by KenLM can potentially
be used as well).

3. Invoking the decoder

There are three main docent binaries:

docent		for decoding a corpus on a single machine without producing
		intermediate output

lcurve-docent	for producing learning curves

mpi-docent	for decoding a corpus on an MPI cluster

I recommend that you use lcurve-docent for experimentation.

Usage: lcurve-docent {-n input.xml|-m input.mmaxdir input.xml} config.xml outputstem

Use the -n or -m switch to provide NIST-XML input only or NIST-XML input
combined with MMAX annotations, respectively.
The file config.xml contains the decoder configuration.

The decoder produces output files for the initial search state and intermediate
states whenever the step number is equal to a power of two, starting at 256.
Output files are named
outstem.000000000.xml
outstem.000000256.xml
etc.

4. Extending the decoder

To implement new feature functions, start with one of the existing.
SentenceParityModel.cpp contains a very simple proof-of-concept feature function that
promotes length parity per document (i.e. all sentences in a document should
consistently have either odd or even length).
If you're planning to implement something more complex, NgramModel.cpp or
SemanticSpaceLanguageModel.cpp may be good places to start.

Good luck!
