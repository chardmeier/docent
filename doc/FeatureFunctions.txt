CONFIG NAME
bracketing-model

NR OF SCORES: 1

PARAMETER: 
 - tags (path to file with space-separated bracket-pairs, one pair per line)

DESCRIPTION:
Counts the number of matching brackets and adds a penalty score for each missing bracket. The model does not look at the positions of brackets and how they are embedded. Supported brackets are tags like [tag] - [/tag] with arbitrary tag names. Additional bracket pairs may be specified in an external file (parameter "tags"). The file should contain space separated bracket pairs with one pair per line. An example pair is '( )'.
