IDEAS
=====

Phrase-table
------------
* Filtering:
  Pick "top N" according to scalar product of scores and PT weights

* Config:
  Have ProbingPT export its "nscores" value (ideally combined with pull request to upstream)
  and use that value instead of "nscores" in config file

Frontends
---------
* lcurve-docent:
  Write learning-curve files exactly until the final configured iteration
  (which may be a lower or higher number than the current hard-coded one)

* Combine all the frontend executable (apart from the trivial test variant)
  into one

* Allow multithreading

* Enhance commandline argument handling by using Boost

* Add unit/regression tests (Boost has a library to help with that)
