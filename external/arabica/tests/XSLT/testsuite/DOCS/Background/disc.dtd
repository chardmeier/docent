  Catalogue of discretionary items in a specification.
  This catalog may be used to generate:
    1. A narrative document about discretionary items
    2. A questionnaire for developers about choices they made
    3. Validation data for an associated test-case catalog

<!-- A question of the "Filter" type should be expressed so that test cases can be
     included/excluded based on the answers; it would typically be used if the
     "status" of the item is not Configuration or Recognized.
     For Configuration, question should elicit information useful to the Test Lab.
     A Prototype question is a general example, which will be instantiated as a
     Filter question for each language/locale represented in the test suite.
     "Recognized" items probably don't warrant a question, hence it's optional. -->

<!-- Don't validate values here, because the function of a document conforming to
     this DTD is to *define* the values. Note, however that the use of "yes" and "no"
     is discouraged for Filter questions (for readability). -->
