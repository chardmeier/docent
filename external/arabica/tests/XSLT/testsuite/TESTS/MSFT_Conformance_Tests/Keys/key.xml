<title>XSLT Usage</title>
  <p>XSLT has a number of implications for the development of XML based 
<term>client/server</term> applications. In addition to performing XML to HTML 
<term>transformations</term>, XSLT can convert XML to a different XML format, can add scripts to perform dynamic 
<term>validation</term> of content, and can interface with 
<term>COM Objects</term> to perform 
<term>automation</term> on such components.</p> 

<p>Additionally, through XSLT you can effectively handle a lot of your 
<term>business logic</term> that is typically found in the 
<term>middle tier</term> of 
<term>three-tier</term> architectures. Thus XSLT can be seen as an addition to 
<term>COM Objects</term> as a means to produce sophisticated 
<term>web applications</term>.
