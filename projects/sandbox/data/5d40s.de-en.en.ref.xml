<seg id="83">The Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field ... and said goodbye to Brooklyn .</seg>
<seg id="84">That guy , he shot Frank Costello in the head and missed .</seg>
<seg id="85">The Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barbershop .</seg>
<seg id="86">It was total chaos .</seg>
<seg id="87">With Anastasia out , Vito Genovese figures he 's the big boss .</seg>
<seg id="88">But Carlo Gambino ... and Joe Bananas had other ideas .</seg>
<seg id="89">So they called a meeting .</seg>
<seg id="90">A big meeting .</seg>
<seg id="91">It was the first time the whole Commission would meet face to face .</seg>
<seg id="92">Bosses and wiseguys were coming from all over the country ... and all the New York families too .</seg>
<seg id="93">Maybe 50 bosses , the whole wiseguy world ... all coming to this little town upstate .</seg>
<seg id="94">My father went with Dom Manetta and Tommy D. Fat Tommy .</seg>
<seg id="95">He was running the family then .</seg>
<seg id="96">Some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting ... at Joe Barbara 's farm , up in the country , nice and quiet .</seg>
<seg id="97">Get away from the car .</seg>
<seg id="98">Want to be a fucking rib eye ?</seg>
<seg id="99">Get away from the car !</seg>
<seg id="100">Turns out the cops were watching Joe Barbara like a hawk ... and some deputy sheriff notices all the traffic and calls the feds .</seg>
<seg id="101">The meeting never even got started .</seg>
<seg id="102">The feds moved in ... and bingo , the bosses , they moved out .</seg>
<seg id="103">My father and Dominic , they hid out in the field with some hay or corn .</seg>
<seg id="104">Along comes a farmer .</seg>
<seg id="105">Dominic bullshits him while my father holds out ... this . 44 cannon he used to carry , and hijacked the tractor .</seg>
<seg id="106">The story is they drove it to Bensonhurst ... but my father told me they only got as far as Poughkeepsie .</seg>
<seg id="107">Anyway , Carlo Gambino came out of it ... capo di tutti capi , " boss of all bosses " ... and that was the last time the Commission tried to meet , until now .</seg>

<seg id="114">Bosses are going to jail .</seg>
<seg id="115">People are getting whacked without permission .</seg>
